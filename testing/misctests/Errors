@ This test should have been created ages ago, to check error messages. I'm
@ starting it now with a few that have changed. Adding others should be done
@ as time permits. Because these are errors during reading, pagination won't
@ be attempted, so errors that are detected there won't show up here. There's
@ a separate test for them.

@ 2010-Dec-01 Still not many tests here!
@ 2019-Nov-23 Still not! But added -em to PMW so that this test can be run
@   with more than 40 errors.
@ 2020-Apr-15 Added some more after getting confused with "skipping" errors.
