the bottom of the first page, suitably placed between the final
system on the page and the footing lines. The positioning is
something which we will have to take care to get right."]

[footnote "This footnote is with bar 9, which is the bar that
gets pushed over onto the next page. See if we can make it long

sentences that might just do the trick if we are lucky."]
