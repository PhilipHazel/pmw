@ This is an example PMS input file showing how the drawing facilities
@ can be used to draw crop marks on pages. Philip Hazel, July 1994.
@ Revised to do a better job, July 1995.
@ ... and again, August 1995!

@ These four definitions specify the position of the crop marks relative to the 
@ area in which PMS prints music. Zero-level for the bottom is the lowest 
@ possible position for a stave; the zero top level is pagelength points above.
@ Note that if a heading is printed at the top of the page, its baseline is at
@ the top zero level, so the actual printing extends a bit higher. The left-hand 
@ zero is the start of systems with no preceding text; the right-hand zero is 
@ linelength points to the right.

@ Increase "top" to move the upper marks upwards; decrease "bottom" to move the 
@ bottom marks down, and similarly for left and right.

*define top     72.5
*define bottom -47.5
*define left   -40
*define right   40

@ Those values are, in fact, the correct values for B5 page images, when the
@ following values are also set:

@ Sheetwidth 499
@ Sheetdepth 709
@ Linelength 420
@ Pagelength 590

@ If the line length or page length is changed, then the top/bottom/left/right
@ values must also be changed correspondingly.

@ The next two definitions specify the size of the crop marks in terms of a 
@ distance from the defining point and the length of the line. Adjust to
@ taste.

*define space 10
*define line  30

@ This drawing routine draws one crop mark at a position and orientation
@ specified on the stack.

@ This drawing routing draws four crop marks at positions defined above, in 
@ the appropriate orientations, when called in a heading directive.

    1 -1 &right magnification div linelength add &bottom magnification div pagelength sub draw onecrop
enddraw

@ These heading directives cause crop marks to be drawn on all pages.

heading draw crops 0
pageheading draw crops 0

@ The remainder of this file consists of some test heading directives to print 
@ in relation to the crop marks. The linelength, pagelength, and sheet 
@ parameters are appropriate for B5 page images. To print these on A4 pages 
@ and have all the crop marks showing you will need to use the image 
@ adjustment feature of the print configuration dialogue box.

@ Replace what follows with your own PMS input file.
    
Sheetwidth 499
Sheetdepth 709
Linelength 420
Pagelength 590

pageheading "<|heading|>"
