** Warning: figured bass string not fully converted to MusicXML - remainder is "A"


Some PMW items cannot be translated to MusicXML. A few items that are ignored
by default can be requested by a -x option. Items that were wholly or partially
ignored while generating XML output are listed below. This is probably not
a complete list:

  Support for headings and footings is only partial
  Only roman, italic, bold, and bold italic fonts are supported
  (8) with brackets for trebletenorB
  Some figured bass notations
  [newline] (use -x+newline to enable)
  [newpage] (use -x+newpage to enable)
  Changing fonts within a footnote
