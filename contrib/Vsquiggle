@ This is a demonstration file showing how to draw a squiggly line vertically
@ through a system, with a bit of white space on either side, in order to 
@ indicate that two bars are not consecutive. It is easiest to position it
@ by reference to a bar line (which gets wiped out). The drawing function
@ must be called from the bottom stave of the system.
