The files in this directory are contributed examples of how to do certain 
things in PMW. Each contains some explanatory comments.

Brackets
  Some draw functions for bracketing notes and noteheads.

Circles
  A draw function for drawing a circle, and another for using this to encircle
  noteheads. There is a small demonstration.

CropMarks
  Draw functions for drawing crop marks.

HandBells
  Some functions for drawing handbell signs.

RubOut
  Macros that can "rub out" rectangular areas. One use is for caesurae that 
  clear the bit of stave underneath them. 
  
SplitArrow
  Drawing functions for end-of-line splitting arrows that are different in 
  style to those in the PMW font. 

TAB
  Macros that show one way of generating guitar tablature on a 4-line stave,
  along with a test. 

Vsquiggle
  How to split and divide a system vertically with a squiggly line.
  
WingedRepeats
  How to generate repeat marks with small "wings" above and below by employing
  the music characters used for system brackets. This gives a different look 
  compared with the winged repeat styles now available in PMW.
