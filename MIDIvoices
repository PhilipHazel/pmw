# This file contains translations between names and MIDI voice
# numbers. Lines that begin with #, and blank lines, are ignored.

# The default file supplied with PMS contains associations that
# correspond to the General MIDI specification. However, the names
# of the instruments don't seem to be standardised, especially
# for some of the "effects". Hence more than one name is given for
# some of them. I have used the names from the Casio CTK-650 for the
# effects.

# ...Names from the Yamaha TG100 added by Richard Hallas.

# Lines must begin with three digits, followed by a space, and then
# the instrument name, without any trailing spaces.
