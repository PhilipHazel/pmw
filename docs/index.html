<h1>Philip's Music Writer (PMW)</h1>
<hr noshade/>

<p>
PMW is a computer program for high quality music typesetting. Originally
written for Acorn RISC OS computers, the current version runs on Unix and
Unix-like systems. It can also be made to run on MacOS and on Windows in the
Cygwin environment. PMW is distributed as a source tarball and licenced under
the GNU GPL. </p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;(released 08 June 2022)
</p>

<p>
The author of PMW is Philip Hazel, whose email address is in the README file in
the PMW distribution. There is a Google Groups discussion list called 
<i>PMW_Music</i> which you can find <a 
href="https://groups.google.com/g/pmw_music">here.</a>


<h2>Overview of PMW</h2>
<p>
PMW operates by reading an input file containing an encoded description of
the music; such a file can be constructed using any text editor or word
processor. The music encoding is compact, and quick to enter once the format
has been learned. The downside is the time needed to learn the format. However,
there are benefits to using textual input, especially when setting music with
lots of repetition. PMW has facilities for repeating notes, bars, or arbitrary
input fragments, and it also supports macros and included files. Conditional
<i>if-then-else</i> sections can be used to encode differences between a score
and individual parts. Textual input also allows for precise control over the
positioning of items. </p>

<p>
The output of PMW is a PostScript file that can be printed on a PostScript
printer, or viewed on screen, printed on a non-PostScript printer, or turned
into a PDF by the use of GhostScript or similar software. PMW can also output 
<i>Encapsulated PostScript</i>, which is suitable for fragments that are to
be included in another document.
</p>

<p>
PMW has its own PostScript outline font that contains all the musical shapes
that it requires. There is a man page for the command line options, and a
200-page manual that is distributed as a PDF file. This contains both
introductory sections and full reference documentation.

<h2>Some features of Philip's Music Writer</h2>

<p>
PMW supports all common forms of notation, including half sharps and flats,
with up to 63 staves per system. Any combination of staves can be selected,
thus allowing the extraction of individual parts or groups of parts from a
score. Headings etc. can be varied according to the selection.
</p>

<p> 
PMW supports transposition, which applies to notes, key signatures, and
key/chord names in text. There is a special key signature with no accidentals
which does not transpose. </p>

<p>
Bar lengths are automatially checked against the time signature, but this can
be overridden. By default, PMW lays out the bars, splits the sequence of bars
up into systems, and allocates the systems to pages. Space can be forced into a
bar at any point; line breaks and page breaks can be forced after any bar.
Alternatively, a pre-imposed layout in terms of the number of bars for each
system and the number of systems for each page can be specified. </p>

<p>
Page length and width can be specified as required. Common paper sizes such as
A3, A4 and &#147letter&#148 are built-in. The music can be magnified or
reduced, and individual staves can be larger or smaller than others. The
spacing between staves and betwen systems is individually controllable, and can
be varied within the piece. A stave spacing of zero can be set to allow two
parts to share a stave. </p>

<p>
Several different styles of note head, bar line, repeat marking, clef, and half
accidental are available, and staves can have from zero to six lines. You can
also specify stemless note heads or stems without note heads.</p>

<p>
There are a number of automatic processing features that can be disabled if not
required. These include collapsing a sequence of rest bars into a
&#147many-bars&#148 rest, and cautionary time and key signatures.
Features that can be requested include overall bar numbering and local
numbering of repeated bars. </p>

<p>
There is some support for laying out music from right to left, something that
is sometimes needed in countries whose language is written that way.
