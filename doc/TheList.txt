                       ======================
                       | THE PMW IDEAS LIST |
                       ======================

This list was updated from the old Risc OS list in January 2009, but only
lightly checked to see if what was listed made sense and was reasonable in the
new implementation.

July 2025: Removed some things that have been implemented in the meantime and
added some comments. The items are in a random order.

Last Updated: January 2026


INFELICITIES
============

* If one stave has a key or time signature and others do not, if space is
needed for an accidental on non-signature stave, refrain from inserting any.

* If no music, don't require PMW-Music. This applies only to PostScript output.

* Position of up/down arpeggios; I think this was because they don't always
come out symmetric.

* Musical offsets - see if error can be given in better terms for aux values.

* Triplets on a group with an accent on the first note and no bracket print
the number too high up.

* {g-\sd\d'-f'-} with no bracket - '3' too low.

* Improve grace note position handling w.r.t. accidentals on other staves, etc.

* Short sloping intermittent lines - dash pattern bad.

* Reduced stave: horizontal semiquaver beams print on stave and look black.
Also demis not good.

* Intermittent lines: short ones have wider gaps. Should anything be done?

* Non-centred tremolo beams for (g'$b') [tremolo] %d'

* Gliss between two adjacent notes should slope a bit.


BIG ENHANCEMENTS
================

* Auto printing of part range at start, and don't affect underlay - Note range
directive, to print between key and time signature.

* Several parts in one run (how?)

* Repeat bars by % sign and also repeats of part bars with / sign. Currently
fudgeable but could be better.

* Hard barline - never split here. Visible and invisible.

* Tremolos to follow maxbeamslope.

* Tremolos with beamed notes.

* Use of colour other than in drawings. Would need major work because stave
lines are output last, but would need to be first. So a pre-scan to find the
line length (or bar length in the case of an [omitempty] bar) would be needed.

* Option for old-fashioned key signature changes - naturalizing key, then
double bar, then new key. Or a mixture, e.g. from E to D, print two naturals
and two sharps.

* Import EPS files for logos or other images etc. easily (check psheading etc to
see if that's OK). That's for PostScript. Is it possible to import anything for
PDF output? SVG? PNG? Any kind of image?

* Time signatures in brackets - could perhaps do with printtime. For things
like 4/4 (12/8).

* Allow transposition by quarter tones (new syntax needed and custom key
signature rules)

* How to handle notes shorter than hdsquaver (if at all)? (Check error 115)

* Update the Makefile so that one can build in another directory. Then enable
the test for this in testing/ManyConfigTests. This is not straightforward.

* Investigate SMuFL (font layout standard)and the (remote) possibility of using
a different music font.

* MIDI 2.0.


MEDIUM ENHANCEMENTS
===================

* Rastral sizes. Drawings? Text? How to specify font sizes?

* Clefs with 15.

* 4-up on A3.

* Spread a single deep system to fill the page. Less inside braced/bracketed
pairs and not for zero spacing. Maybe a control for which?

* Auto-increment rehearsal letters. Could use draw.

* Leave blank page - relevant if 2-up printing.

* Make couple work for all clefs - require "coupleclefcheck" directive to
enable the large amount of work necessary?

* Ornaments on non-first note of chord? Also accents.

* Change couple point.

* Move bracket and brace.

* Startlinespacing for individual systems.

* Antique time signature of three quarter circle with dot in middle.

* [long cue] or [cue n] for n cue bars

* Directive to leave space at the top of this page.

* Add pageheading/footing in new movement without destroying old ones.

* Make [space] work after an auxiliary item, e.g. [treble][space] G

* Non-standard clefs, e.g. higher or lower than usual.

* Double clefs, e.g. [treble bass] every time.

* Make [move] apply to whole bar rests. (Note, it applies to the number over
multi-bar rests at present.)

* Dotted bar lines between staves, but not over the staves, at certain points,
a la : - e.g. :: (need options break/nobreak).

* [top/bottom margin] for rest of piece

* Centre time signatures on 2nd and 3rd lines rather than attach to centre line?

* [breakbarlines]?  That is, change the settings from within a stave.

* [beamendrests]?  Ditto.

* Make g-\g/\ work in beams.

* Lines with arrowheads.

* Redo routine that calculates note bounding boxes; need separate above/below
sets of flags to cope with chords and their accidentals and above/below bowing.
What is this used for?

* Warn if two-up printing likely to go over paper edge.

* A `pad' command to assume bar filled without actually spacing notes.

* A way of printing a time signature large above a group of instruments (maybe
using stave 0 and a way of moving up) combined with no ts on following staves
(see [notime] below). Search for an example.

* [barlinestyle invisible] that is, force all barlines to be invisible.


SMALL ENHANCEMENTS
==================

* If linegap width less than 1, treat as fraction? Or implement a percentage
notation? What about split lines?

* [notime] for a single stave, or possibly an option of [stave] like omitempty.


UNLIKELY ENHANCEMENTS
=====================

* Guitar notation

* [Transpose] in stave 0 to apply to all parts for just those bars

* Remember pagination for subsequent re-processing.

* An option to cause slurs to default on the opposite side from stems.
Majority of stems? First stem? Only if all stems same way?

* Conditional bar squashing, e.g. if shortest note in a bar is crotchet, then
spread *3/4 and so on. Squashing must happen to all note positions after
initial creation but before inserting clefs, etc.

* Hint mechanism for line/page breaks. How does this interact with layout?

* Things on stave 0 to apply to all staves: key/time/doublenotes...

* Bars of different length in renaissance styles.

* Beam over crotchet rests.

* Lastfootnote directive for text at end.


HAIRPINS
========

* Auto-scale hairpinwidths from a given range that is user settable. Short
ones must be narrower. Maybe what we need is an aspect ratio... Note there may
be problems with < followed by > when you want the two to be the same size,
even if different lengths.

* /bu option for hairpins.


ACCENTS AND ORNAMENTS
=====================

* Bowing above rests.

* Arpeggio across two staves.

* \n\ for nail ornament.

* Accents on stem side of notes. Move some of them - e.g. staccato to be
nearer the stem. Also, when on a chord with notes on both sides, it may look
better to print such accents centred on the stem.

* Different accents on different sides of a note. Would require keeping two
sets of flags for above/below on chords so that slur computations work right.

* Small accidentals above more ornaments - e.g. mordant, turn.

* Turn halfway between notes.

* Fermata over trill overprints.

* Fermata over bar line.

* Easier notation for staccato and overbar.

* Trills below notes + mordents + turns + auto option.

* Option to print > accents inside staves (with closed point mid-way between
lines).

Option to force expression marks above/below.


ODDITIES
========

* Improve [95]Q! when [nocheck] and bars of different lengths in other stave.


DRAWING
=======

* Draw in printtime and key.

* Add end cap styles: triangle, circle, arrowhead.

* Line styles

* Drawing relative to a text item, e.g. "text"/draw=thing.

* A version of headright that takes dots into account.

* A variable to say if (and how many) dots are present on a note.

* A variable to say what this drawing is attached to (heading, note, bar, etc.)

* A variable containing the number of arguments to a draw call.

* String concatenation using "add".


ERRORS
======

* When complaining about bars of unequal length, give the lengths in the same
units (i.e. both in crotchets, or quavers, or whatever).


TEXT
====

* White-out box option /w - needs save till end of line.

* /ts aligns with the middle of a bar if there is no time signature and the
bar is R! or Q! or S!.

* Align verse numbers? How?

* [Beammove] doesn't affect ulevel - or text level.

* Warn if underlay syllable crosses a rest.

* Conditional /e that applies only in the last bar of a line.

* Raising text on stave-above strings - need a general default.

* Tab facility in stave headings.

* Hymn verses, possibly including drawings.

* /f for first note of bar position. Do we still need this, given /ts?

* /ul<n> (and /ol) to set level for individual strings

* Force underlay extension for non-chordal doubled parts - go 1/2 way to next
note. Choose some new character.

* Equivalent of ^ for left-hanging.

* An option to add a given adjustment to subsequent automatically computed
underlay levels. (Effectively, to adjust the default level.)

* Make /bar work for "#"/ul ?

* Invent options for text box thickness.

* Underlaystyle applies to both underlay and overlay. Should there be a
separate overlaystyle?

* Vertical positioning to look at subsequent notes as well as current. Would
need to be possible to turn this off for backwards compatibility.


CHORDS
======

* When more than 2 ties in a chord, make the outer ones shorter, to be more
like the inner ones.

* Make glissando work on the outermost notes of a chord.

* Improve automatic accidental positioning?

* Tie sign within chord brackets to tie just that note.

* Breve chords - option to open the bars for all noteheads. Also option to join
bars vertically even if notes far apart.


TRIPLETS
========

* Triplets with slur instead of brackets.

* Query {b-a-b- f-e-d-}


NOTES
=====

* Amadeus-style input c8d8 etc. Omit either component for repeat. Once started,
how to turn off? C+- or something? Perhaps don't turn off. Maybe nowadays ABC
would be a better "standard" notation?

* Rectangular shaped breves.

* Unison breve - masquerade?

* General notation for unisons?

* Support for longs - masquerade only?

* The Bach `slide' ornament - can this be done with sloping text?

* A way to set a default for expression marks to be above or below the note.

* Diamond noteheads with stems coming from the top of the diamond.

* Natural-sharp and natural-flat accidentals.

* Tidy handling of n_flags. Relates to chords. Need to keep two separate values
for above/below flags.


SLURS AND LINES
===============

* Make half a split slur wiggly independently - /slw and /srw.

* Independent editorial flags for parts of split slurs.

* Independent /i and /ip flags too.

* Control of dash parameters of [line].

* Moving the tick in editorial slurs - can do with slurgap, but maybe useful to
allow t setting /e0.25 etc.

* Control of slur fatness. Should scale with stave size, if it doesn't
already.

* Thin off slurs more?

* Option to cause slur to start at edge of notehead. See also ties.

* In [slur] allow \-1\ to refer to the last section of a split.

* After calls to slur_endslur(), when should any gapstr attached blocks be
freed? The main block is freed (cached) in slur_endslur() because it is used
immediately, but we can't do the same with the gaps because there is a chain of
them.


TIES
====

* Improve ties for (gab)_(gab) and (gab)_(g\sd\ab), i.e. when opposite side
notes exist.

* Ties to the middle of noteheads, as specified by Martin Muellbauer.

* Centres of ties NOT to hit stave lines.

* A way of controlling the thickness of ties.


BEAMS
=====

* Beam slopes: e'-g'-c'- and c'-g'-e'- do not come out symmetric owing to its
looking only at the first note extension.

* Shorten beamlets if notes close together?


GRACE NOTES
===========

* Do better if different numbers of grace notes on different staves.

* Text not to align with grace note if no grace note on this stave.


BAR NUMBERS
===========

* Bar numbers on listed staves, a la stave zero.

* Bar numbers at, for example, 5,9,13,...

* Resetting bar numbers (for use in repeats or other strange cases). Hard. How
then are bars identified?

* A way of aligning bar numbers at the ends of bars.

* Align boxes, not text, with bar lines, when boxing is happening.


MIDI
====

* Nested repeats, e.g. the Bielawa sample.

* [miditempo nn] or miditempo n.m +/- t or [miditempo *a.b]

* [miditempo -> n] gradual change of n notes?


MUSIC FONT
==========

.section "Music font"

* Wind symbols

* Other noteheads

* Conductor symbols

* Rectangular breve

* Elliptic accent
