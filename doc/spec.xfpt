.chapter "Introduction"
&'Philip's Music Writer'& (PMW) is a computer program for typesetting music. It
is not a music processor or a sequencer. Its aim is the production of high
quality sheet music. PMW is not a screen-based program; it is run from the
command line. It reads an input file containing an encoded description of some
music &-- such a file can be constructed using any text editor or
wordprocessor. Although a textual input method may not be considered as
user-friendly as pointing and dragging on the screen, it can be a much faster
way of inputting music once the format of the input file has been learned. In
addition, the usual facilities of a text editor, such as cutting and pasting,
can be used to speed up entry, and PMW is also able to provide text-based
features such as macros, included files, and shorthands for repetitive input.
The textual encoding is unique to PMW. If you want to get a flavour of PMW
input before deciding whether or not to install PMW, take a look at chapter
&<<CHAPfirstintro>>& below.

From release 5.10 PMW can also read and typeset some music encoded as MusicXML,
which is a format used for interchanging encoded music between different
processing programs. However, this is still very much an experimental feature
that is not yet of production quality. Moreover, only a subset of MusicXML
features are supported. It is very much `work in progress' and therefore
relegated to appendix &<<APPA>>& of this document.

Similarly, from release 5.33, PMW can optionally write a copy of the music in
MusicXML format. This, too, is experimental and incomplete. It is documented in
appendix &<<APPB>>&.

The main output of PMW is either a PostScript or a PDF (Portable Document
Format) file. The former format can be `encapsulated PostScript', which can be
useful if the music is an illustration that will subsequently be included in
another document. For a discussion of PostScript versus PDF, see chapter
&<<CHAPPDFPS>>&. In addition to its normal output, PMW can also write a MIDI
file for playing through the computer's sound system. MIDI output is not at all
sophisticated, and is intended for `proof-hearing' purposes rather than for
performance.

Early versions of PMW were called &'Philip's Music Scribe'&, and ran on Acorn's
RISC OS operating system in the 1990s. Version 4.00 was the first version for
Linux and other Unix-like environments. This edition of the manual describes
PMW version &version;. Version 5.00 was a major re-working of the code to
properly integrate half accidentals and custom key signatures, to improve the
way character strings are processed, to remove obsolete features, and to
generally overhaul what is now quite old code. Chapter &<<CHAP500>>& has
details of the changes; in the majority of cases existing input files should
continue to work without change or with only minor adjustments.

PMW comes with a font called PMW-Music. This contains all the music shapes
(notes, rests, accidentals, bar lines, clefs, etc.) that PMW requires. I
acknowledge with gratitude the help of Richard Hallas, who created the original
versions of some of the characters in this font and improved many others. The
half sharp and half flat characters were contributed by Hosam Adeeb Nashed.
Richard also contributed a second font called PMW-Alpha. It contains additional
characters that may be useful for certain types of music (see chapter
&<<CHAPpmwalpha>>&).

The PMW input encoding is intended to be easy for a musician to remember. It
makes use of as many familiar music notations as possible within the
limitations of the computer's character set. Normally it is input by a human,
using any available word processor or text editor. However, PMW input could
also be be the output of some other computer program that captures (or
generates) music.

This introduction ends with a short summary of the musical and other
terminology used in this manual. The following two chapters describe how PMW
should be installed and operated. Chapters &<<CHAPfirstintro>>& and
&<<CHAPlastintro>>& are an introduction to the PMW input encoding. They cover
most of the more common requirements, with examples, in an introductory manner.
Chapter &<<CHAPstdmacs>>& describes the `standard macros' that are supplied
with PMW.

The bulk of the manual (from chapter &<<CHAPreference>>& onwards) is reference
material; the information in earlier chapters is repeated, with additional
specialist information. Finally, there are chapters giving details of text
fonts, the PMW music fonts, summaries of the syntax of input files, and an
index. Many cross-references are given in a shortened form using a pointing
hand symbol, for example, &R; &<<SECTsetdefop>>&. These cross-references are
clickable when this PDF is displayed by software that supports the facility.


.section "Terminology"
.index "terminology"
.index "default" "definition of term"
The word `default' occurs frequently in this manual. It means some value or
option setting that is used when the user does not supply any alternative. For
example, if no key signature is given for a piece, the default that is used is
C major.

The word `directive' is used as the name for instructions in the input file
that tell PMW what to do. There are directives that control the overall form of
the piece, and others that operate within individual staves.

The word `argument' refers to a data value that is provided on the command line
for running PMW, or is coded as part of a directive. For example, the directive
to set the page length has to be followed by one number; this is its argument
(the usage is taken from mathematics and computer programming).

The word `parameter' refers to a data value that controls the format of the
typeset music. For example, there is a parameter whose value is the width of
lines of music. All parameters have default values, but these can usually be
changed by an appropriate directive.

Some formal music terminology is also used; it is summarized here for the
benefit of readers who may not be fully familiar with it. I use the British
names for notes: breve, semibreve, minim, crotchet, quaver, semiquaver, etc.

A &'beam'& is a thick line that is used to join together a number of quavers or
shorter notes, instead of each note having its own separate flags.

A &'brace'& is a curly sign that is used to join together two staves that are
to be played on a single instrument, for example the two staves of keyboard
music.

A &'bracket'& is another sign used for joining staves together. It is like a
large square bracket and is used to join together staves of music for different
instruments, for example, the four staves needed for a string quartet.

A &'caesura'& is a pause mark that appears between notes; it is normally
two short sloping lines through the top line of the stave.

A &'fermata'& is the pause mark that is placed over or under notes, consisting
of a semicircle with a dot at its centre.

A &'flag'& is the name used for the additional marks added to the stem of a
note to indicate that it is shorter than a crotchet. A quaver has one flag, a
semiquaver has two, and so on.

&'Overlay'& is the word used to describe text that appears above a stave in a
vocal part. Usually, such words are below the stave, and are called
&'underlay'& (see below), but occasionally alternative words appear above.

A &'stave'& is a single set of horizontal lines on which notes appear. The
normal stave contains five lines, but other numbers of lines are sometimes
used, for example, a single line for percussion parts. In this document, the
word `stave' is used as the singular of `staves'. However, the program itself
accepts `staff' as a synonym of `stave' under all circumstances.

The &'stem'& of a note is the vertical line that is drawn either upwards or
downwards from the notehead, for all notes shorter than a semibreve.

A &'system'& is a single line of music, comprising one or more staves, and
usually joined at the left-hand side in some way. For example, the systems of a
string quartet score each contain four staves.

&'Underlay'& is the word used to describe text that appears under a stave in
a vocal part, that is, the words that are to be sung. The less formal term
`lyrics' is often used for this in the context of popular songs.

.chapter "Installing and setting up PMW"
.index-from I01 "installing PMW"
.index "Windows, running PMW under"
.index "MacOS X, running PMW under"
.index "Cygwin environment"
PMW is developed on a Linux system, but as it is a straightforward C program
without any kind of fancy interface, it should run on any system with a C
compiler and runtime system. However, the only provided building scheme uses
Unix-style &_configure_& and &_Makefile_& files, which should work in any
Unix-like environment, including the Cygwin environment under Microsoft
Windows and the command line in MacOS. The author of PMW has no Windows
experience, but Neil Killeen, a PMW user, has kindly provided notes on running
PMW under Windows. These may be found in the PMW distribution tarball in the
file &_doc/Cygwin.txt_&. There are also some contributed notes on running under
MacOS in the file &_doc/MacOS.txt_&.

In a Unix-like environment, PMW is installed from source in the same way as
many other applications. First, download the tarball into a suitable directory.
You should end up with a file such as &_pmw-&version;.tar.gz_&. First unpack
the archive:
.display
&`tar -xf pmw-&version;.tar.gz`&
.endd
This creates a directory called &_pmw-&version;_&, containing a number of files
and directories. Of interest for later are the &_doc_& directory, which
contains documentation, and the &_contrib_& directory, which contains files
that have been contributed by PMW users in the hope they may prove useful to
others. Each of these contributed files has comments at the top, explaining
what its contents are. To build and install PMW, make the source directory
current, and then issue the usual &(configure)& and &(make)& commands:
.display
&`cd pmw-&version;`&
&`./configure`&
&`make`&
&`make check`&
&`make install`&
.endd
.index "default" "installation directory"
You may need to be &'root'& to run the installation command. By default, this
installs into the &_/usr/local_& directory. If you want to install PMW
somewhere else, you can specify a different `prefix' when configuring. For
example:
.code
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/pmw
.endd
The files that are installed in the prefix directory are as follows:
.ilist
&_bin/pmw_& is the PMW command.
.next
&_man/man1/pmw.1_& is a short `man' page that describes the command line
options for PMW.
.next
&_share/pmw/macros_& is a directory that contains files of `standard macros'
(&R; &<<CHAPstdmacs>>&).
.next
&_share/pmw/MIDIperc_& contains translations between names such as `acoustic
bass drum' and MIDI pitches for untuned percussion voices.
.next
&_share/pmw/MIDIvoices_& contains translations between names such as `piano'
and MIDI voice numbers.
.next
&_share/pmw/PSheader_& is a header file for PMW's PostScript output.
.next
&_share/pmw/psfonts/PMW-Music.pfa_& and &_share/pmw/psfonts/PMW-Music.otf_&
are both copies of the PMW-Music font, in two different formats. The first is a
PostScript Type 1 font and the second is an OpenType font.
.next
&_share/pmw/psfonts/PMW-Alpha.pfa_& and &_share/pmw/psfonts/PMW-Alpha.otf_&
are both copies of an auxiliary music font, in the same two formats as
PMW-Music.
.next
.index "fonts" "metrics"
&_share/pmw/fontmetrics/_& is a directory that contains files giving character
widths and kerning information for the standard set of PDF and PostScript fonts
and the PMW music fonts. There are also two files with &_.utr_& extensions;
these contain translations from Unicode code points to the default code points
in the &'Symbol'& font and the &'PMW-Music'& font (&R;
&<<SUBSECTuniutf>>&).
.endlist
As well as the usual &(configure)& options, there are four that are specific
to PMW:
.ilist
&`--disable-pmwrc`& cuts out the code that looks for a file called
&_.pmwrc_& in the user's home directory (&R; &<<SECTsetdefop>>&). This code
uses Unix-specific functions so must be omitted in other environments.
.next
&`--enable-b2pf`& causes PMW to be built with support for using the B2PF
library, which converts Unicode text strings from their base to their
`presentation' forms, a facility that is useful for scripts such as Arabic.
This option requires the B2PF library to be installed. See section
&<<SUBSECTb2pffont>>& for details of how to use this facility.
.next
&`--enable-musicxml`& causes PMW to be built with support for reading and
writing MusicXML files. This is experimental code which is far from complete.
See appendix &<<APPA>>& and appendix &<<APPB>>& for details.
.next
.index "PDF" "set as default"
&`--enable-pdf-default`& sets PMW's default main output format to be PDF.
Otherwise it is PostScript.
.endlist

Once you have installed PMW, you can use the &(pmw)& command to generate
PostScript or PDF output, as described in the next chapter. The subsequent
chapter (&R; &<<CHAPpmwoutput>>&) discusses what to do with PMW output.


.section "Uninstalling PMW"
.index "uninstalling PMW"
If you want to uninstall PMW, you can use the command:
.code
make uninstall
.endd
This removes the files that were installed. It does not remove directories.

.chapter "The PMW command" CHAPrunningpmw
.index-from I02 "command line interface"
.index "default" "output destination"
The PMW command has the following form:
.display
&`pmw`& [&'options'&] [&'input file'&]
.endd
The items in square brackets are optional. If no file name is given, input is
read from the standard input and by default the output is written to the
standard output. When a file name is given, the default output file name is the
input file with the extension &_.ps_& (for PostScript output) or &_.pdf_& (for
PDF output) replacing any existing extension, or being added if there is no
extension. The default output format (PostScript or PDF) is specified when PMW
is built, but can be overridden by the &%-ps%& or &%-pdf%& options. The default
output destination can be overridden by the &%-o%& option. Error messages and
verification output are written to the standard error file, which can be
re-directed in the usual way. Here are some examples of PMW commands:
.code
pmw sonata 2>errors
pmw -p 3-4 mozartscore
pmw -format A5 -a5ona4 -pamphlet myscore
pmw -pdf -s 3 -o quartet.pdf quartet.pmw
pmw -ps -f viola -o quartet.ps -midi /tmp/quartet.mid quartet.pmw
.endd


.section "General command line options"
.index "command line options"
.index "options" "command line"
These options apply to both PostScript and PDF output.

.vlist
.vitem &%-a4ona3%&

There are several directives that control the size of the page images PMW
produces (&R; &<<SECTpapersizes>>&). In the common case, this size is identical
to the paper size, in which case one image fits exactly onto one piece of paper
when printed.
.index "two-up printing"
However, PMW also supports &'two-up'& imposition, in which two page images are
put next to each other, to be printed on a larger piece of paper. This option
specifies that the music images are A4-sized, but are to be arranged two-up,
suitable for printing on A3 paper.

.vitem &%-a5ona4%&

The pages are A5-sized; arrange them two-up, suitable for A4 paper. The
&%sheetsize%& directive should be used to set the image size to A5.

.vitem "&%-C%& <&'arg'&>"

Show the setting of a build-time option and then exit with its value, which
is 1 for `set' and 0 for `unset'. The possible arguments are &`b2pf`& for B2PF
support (&R; &<<SUBSECTb2pffont>>&) and &`musicxml`& for MusicXML support (&R;
&<<APPA>>&, &<<APPB>>&).

.vitem &%-drawbarlines%&

.index "bar lines" "drawing"
Bar lines are normally output using characters from the music font. This option
causes them to be output using drawing commands. It may produce better output
in environments where some PostScript/PDF interpreters leave little gaps in bar
lines that extend over more than one stave. &%-dbl%& is a synonym for
&%-drawbarlines%&. See also the &%drawbarlines%& header directive.

.vitem &%-drawstavelines%&

.index "stave lines" "drawing"
.index "stave lines" "thickness"
Staves are normally output using characters from the music font. This option
causes them to be output as individually drawn lines. It may produce better
output in environments where some PostScript/PDF interpreters leave gaps in
staves. The default thickness of the drawn stave lines is 0.3 points, scaled
according to the relative stave size and any overall magnification. You can
change this by giving a number after the option. The units are tenths of a
point, so specifying, for example
.code
-drawstavelines 4
.endd
draws stave lines whose thickness is 0.4 points. A value of zero disables the
drawing of stave lines. &%-dsl%& is a synonym for &%-drawstavelines%&; a
non-zero value for this option overrides &%-nowidechars%&. See also the
&%drawstavelines%& header directive.

.vitem &%-eps%&

.index "PostScript" "encapsulated"
.index "encapsulated PostScript (EPS)"
Write the output as encapsulated PostScript. This option is mutually exclusive
with &%-pdf%&. Encapsulated PostScript is useful if the music is an
illustration that will subsequently be included in another document. For
one-off illustrations, combining &%-eps%& with &%-incPMWfont%& is advised so
that the PMW-Music font is automatically included. However, for a document with
many musical illustrations, including the font in each one is undesirable; it
is better to make it available in some other way (&R; &<<CHAPPDFPS>>&). See
also the &%eps%& header directive.

One PMW user reported problems with EPS files when other special fonts were
also required. The solution was to pass all the fonts and the EPS file into the
open-source Scribus desktop publishing program, convert to B&eacute;zier
curves, then re-export as EPS. This removes font references, and produces a
file that can easily be embedded in any DTP program.

.vitem "&%-F%& <&'directory list'&>"

.index "fonts" "metrics"
Search the directories in the colon-separated list for &_fontmetrics_&
(&_.afm_&) files and other font-related files, before searching the default
directory that was set up when PMW was installed. This option is useful when
you want to make use of a non-standard font in text strings without having to
copy files into the default directory. Relative file names are taken as
relative to the current directory, not to the PMW input file's directory.

.vitem "&%-f%& <&'name'&>"

.index "format option"
This option specifies a format name, which is useful when the input file is set
up to generate output in several different formats. The format name can be
tested by the &%*if%& directive and used to vary the output. For example, a
piece might be arranged for either flutes or recorders. The user chooses words
to describe each different format, and specifies the appropriate one here. See
chapter &<<CHAPlastintro>>& for details of how to set up the input so as to
output different headings and so forth when different stave selections or
formats are requested.

.vitem "&%-help%& or &%--help%&"

Output what the default output format is, which optional features are
supported, and a list of command line options, then stop. No file is read.

.vitem "&%-MP%& <&'file'&>"

Use the given file as the &_MIDIperc_& file, instead of the default that was
set up when PMW was installed. If a relative file name is given, it is taken as
relative to the current directory, not to the PMW input file's directory. This
file contains translations between names and MIDI `pitches' for untuned
percussion voices. Apart from comment lines (starting with #) and empty lines,
each line in the file must begin with three digits, followed by a space, and
the instrument name, without any trailing spaces. For example:
.code
035 acoustic bass drum
036 bass drum 1
037 side stick
038 acoustic snare
.endd

.vitem "&%-MV%& <&'file'&>"

Use the given file as the &_MIDIvoices_& file, instead of the default that was
set up when PMW was intalled. If a relative file name is given, it is taken as
relative to the current directory, not to the PMW input file's directory. This
file contains translations between names and MIDI voice numbers. Apart from
comment lines (starting with #) and empty lines, each line in the file must
begin with three digits, followed by a space, and then the instrument name,
without any trailing spaces. The same number may appear more than once. For
example:
.code
001 piano
001 acoustic grand piano
002 hard piano
002 bright acoustic piano
003 studio piano
003 electric grand piano
.endd

.vitem "&%-midi%& <&'file'&>"

.index "MIDI" "command line option"
This option specifies that MIDI output should be written to the given file.
This is in addition to the normal PostScript or PDF output. Only a single
movement can be output as MIDI; when the input file contains multiple
movements, the &%-midimovement%& option (synonym &%-mm%&) can be used to select
which one. The stave selection specified by &%-s%& applies, and the
bars that are output can be selected by &%-midibars%& (synonym &%-mb%&). The
page selection option does not apply to MIDI output. See section &<<SECTmidi>>&
for more about MIDI output.

.vitem "&%-midibars%& <&'start'&>&%-%&<&'end'&>"

Limit the bars that are written to a MIDI file to the specified range (&%-mb%&
is a synonym). Fractional bar numbers can be used to refer to uncounted bars.
If this option is not given, the entire movement is included in the MIDI
output. The page selection option does not apply to MIDI output. If the end bar
number is omitted, but the hyphen is present, output continues to the end of
the movement. If just one number is given, just one bar is output.

.vitem "&%-midimovement%& <&'number'&>"

This option specifies which movement is to be output as MIDI (&%-mm%& is a
synonym). Only one movement can be output in this manner. The default is the
first movement in the file.

.vitem "&%-musicxml%& <&'file'&> or &%-xml%& <&'file'&>"

When PMW has been built with MusicXML support, this option requests additional
output in the form of one or more MusicXML files. See appendix &<<APPB>>& for
more details.

.vitem "&%-musicxmlmovement%& <&'number'&> or &%-xmlmovement%& <&'number'&> or &%-xm%& <&'number'&>"

Only one movement can be contained in a MusicXML file; this option selects
a movement that is then written to a single file. The default is the first
movement, unless there are multiple movements and the XML file name contains
`%d'. See appendix &<<APPB>>& for details.

.vitem "&%-norc%& or &%-nopmwrc%&"

If this option is used, it must be the very first option that follows the
&(pmw)& command name. It causes PMW not to read the user's &_.pmwrc_& file (&R;
&<<SECTsetdefop>>&). Note that PMW can be built without support for &_.pmwrc_&
files; when this is the case this option is ignored.

.vitem "&%-norepeats%& or &%-nr%&"

When generating a MIDI output file, do not repeat repeated sections of the
music.

.vitem "&%-nowidechars%& or &%-nw%&"

This option stops PMW from using wide characters for staves. It is provided
because it seems that some PostScript/PDF interpreters cannot deal correctly
with characters whose width is 100 points at the default magnification
(compared with 10 points for the narrow versions). A 310-point 5-line stave is
normally output using the string FFFC. (The code numbers of wide and narrow
5-line stave characters in the music font correspond to F and C in text fonts.)
With &%-nowidechars%&, the same stave is output as
CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC. The &%-drawstavelines%& option overrides this
option. See also the &%nowidechars%& header directive.

.vitem "&%-o%& <&'file'&>"

Write the main output to the given file, or, if a single hyphen is given
as the file name, to the standard output. A file name should be given
with the required extension (for example, &_etude.pdf_&, not just &_etude_&).

.vitem "&%-p%& <&'list'&>"

Output only the specified pages. These can be individual page numbers, or pairs
of numbers separated by a hyphen, to specify a range. Use commas to separate
items in the list.
.code
pmw -p 4,6,7-10,13
.endd
This specifies that pages 4, 6, 7 to 10, and 13 are to be output. The page
selection does not apply to MIDI output; use &%midibars%& and &%midimovement%&
instead.

.vitem &%-pamphlet%&

.index "pages in pamphlet order"
The &%-pamphlet%& page ordering option is useful when a two-up page output
format is selected by &%-a4ona3%& or &%-a5ona4%&. In pamphlet mode, the piece
is notionally extended with blank pages, if necessary, so that the number of
the last page is a multiple of four. Page 1 is then paired with the last page,
page 2 with the second last page, and so on. The odd-numbered page of the pair
is always output on the right (except when right-to-left layout is enabled
(&R; &<<SUBSECTrighttoleft>>&), but that is unusual). The resulting pages, if
printed two-sided, can be stacked together and folded in the middle to form a
`pamphlet'.

If the first page of the piece has a number greater than 1, earlier pages are
output as blanks, as are any internal missing pages &-- these can be created by
using page increments other than one, or by explicitly skipping pages.

Outputting all pages at once on a single-sided printer is useful for producing
master copies for reproduction elsewhere. If you want to produce a final
two-sided copy directly, use &%-pamphlet%& with &%-printside%& 1 to output all
the first sides, and then use &%-printside%& 2 to output the second sides for
printing on the backs of the same sheets. On a duplex (two-sided) PostScript
printer you may need to set the &%-tumble%& option to get all the pages the
right way up.

When selecting individual pages to output with the pamphlet option, you should
select only one member of each pair. The partner page is automatically added to
each selected page, so selecting both pages will result in two copies being
output. For normal two-up printing, PMW centres the page images in the half
pages in which they appear, but in pamphlet mode they are abutted together in
the middle. This means that, when the sheetsize is smaller than half the paper
size, any marks printed outside the sheetsize (crop marks, for example) are
visible.

.vitem &%-pdf%&

.index "PDF" "command line option"
Generate PDF output. This option is mutually exclusive with &%-ps%& and
&%-eps%&. It is necessary only when PMW has been built with its default output
format set to PostScript.

.vitem "&%-printadjust%& <&'x'&> <&'y'&>"

.index "image position adjustment"
Experience has revealed that not all printing methods position the image in
exactly the same position on the page. These two values specify a movement of
the image on the page, in printers' points (1/72 of an inch). The movement is
relative to the normal reading orientation of the page images (which may be
rotated on the paper). The first value is left-to-right, and the second is up
and down. Positive values move the image to the right and upwards,
respectively, and negative values move it in the opposite directions.

.vitem "&%-printgutter%& <&'x'&>"

.index "gutter between pages"
This option specifies a distance by which righthand (recto) page images are
moved to the right, and lefthand (verso) page images are moved to the left,
thus creating a `gutter' for binding when the images are printed doublesided.
The &%-printgutter%& setting applies only when pages are being printed 1-up.
It is ignored for any of the 2-up printing styles.

.vitem "&%-printscale%& <&'n'&>"

Scale the output page images by <&'n'&>. This differs from the PMW
&%magnification%& header directive (&R; &<<SECTmagnification>>&) in that it
affects the size of each page, whereas &%magnification%& applies only to the
contents of the page.

.vitem "&%-printside%& <&'n'&>"

.index "page side selection"
Output only odd or only even pages; <&'n'&> must either be 1 or 2. The side
selection options make it easy to print on both sides of pages by feeding them
through the printer twice, without having to set up an explicit page selection
each time. When pamphlet mode is selected, it is the lower of the two page
numbers that is tested. When a 2-up non-pamphlet mode is selected, this option
is disabled, and all selected pages are always output.

.vitem &%-ps%&

.index "PostScript" "command line option"
Generate PostScript output. This option is mutually exclusive with &%-pdf%&. It
is necessary only when PMW has been built with its default output format set to
PDF.

.vitem &%-reverse%&

Output the pages in reverse order. The default order is in ascending sequence
of page number if no pages are explicitly selected; otherwise the order is as
selected by the user. Reverse order is precisely the opposite of this. It is
useful for printers that stack face-up, and also in some two-sided printing
operations.

.vitem "&%-s%& <&'list'&>"

Output only the specified staves. These can be individual stave numbers, or
pairs of numbers separated by a hyphen, to specify a range. Use commas to
separate items in the list.
.code
pmw mozart -s 1,3-5,9-12
.endd
Setting values here is how you select one or more individual parts to be
extracted from a score. For example, in a work for choir and orchestra, to
create a vocal score from only the voice parts, one might specify &`11-14`& if
the vocal parts were on staves 11&--14. More often, just a single number is
given, in order to generate an individual instrumental part. See chapter
&<<CHAPlastintro>>& for details of how to set up the input so as to output
different headings and so forth for different stave selections.

.vitem "&%-t%& <&'number'&>"

.index "transposition" "command line option"
Specify a transposition, in semitones. A positive number specifies upwards
transposition, and a negative one downwards transposition. A transposition of
zero may also be entered; this is not the same as no transposition at all. For
details of transposition, see section &<<SECTtransposition>>&.

.vitem "&%-V%& or &%--version%&"

Output the PMW version number to the standard output, then stop. No file is
read.

.vitem &%-v%&

Output verification information about the typesetting to the standard error
file (&R; &<<SECTinfo>>&).

.vitem "&%-x%&&'<selectors>'&"

Set one or more options for MusicXML output. The selectors are a sequence of
words, separated by plus or minus characters. See appendix &<<APPB>>& for
details.

.endlist


.section "Options for PostScript output"
.index "PostScript" "printer options"
These options are useful if PostScript output from PMW is sent to a printer
that interprets PostScript. They have no effect if the output is viewed on the
screen or converted to a PDF, and they give a warning if given when PMW is
generating a PDF itself.

.vlist
.vitem &%-a4sideways%&

Rotate the page images by 90 degrees. This can be useful for a printer that
has a sideways paper feed.

.vitem "&%-c%& <&'number'&>"

Set the number of copies to be printed as <&'number'&>.

.vitem &%-duplex%&

Set the `duplex' option in the generated PostScript output. This should be
honoured by PostScript printers that can print on both sides of the paper.

.vitem "&%-H%& <&'file'&>"

Use the given file as the PostScript header file, instead of the default that
was set up when PMW was installed. If a relative file name is given, it is
taken as relative to the current directory, not to the PMW input file's
directory. This option is unlikely to be of general use, but is helpful when
testing new versions of the header file.

.vitem "&%-incPMWfont%& or &%-incpmwfont%& or &%-ipf%&"

This option causes PMW to include the PostScript Type 1 PMW-Music font within
the PostScript output that it generates. If the PMW-Alpha font is used, that is
also included. If you use this option, there is no need to install the font(s)
for &'GhostScript'& (or any other display program). However, it does mean that
each PMW output file is bigger by about 40K for PMW-Music and 31K for
PMW-Alpha. Note that this option applies only to PMW's music fonts. See also
the &%incPMWfont%& header directive. The &%textfont%& directive (&R;
&<<SUBSECTtextfont>>&) provides a way of including other fonts in PostScript
output.

.vitem &%-manualfeed%&

Set the `manualfeed' option in the generated PostScript. Most PostScript
printers interpret this to mean that the paper should be taken from an
alternate input tray or slot. Some also require the user to push a button
before each page is printed.

.vitem &%-tumble%&

When &%-duplex%& is set, &%-tumble%& sets the PostScript option for `tumbled'
duplex printing.
.endlist


.section "Maintenance and debugging options"
.index "options" "debugging"
The following options are of interest only to a PMW maintainer. They are listed
here for completeness, but few details are included. There is further
information in a file called &_HACKNOTES_& in the &_doc_& directory of the PMW
distribution.

.vlist
.vitem "&%-d%&&'<selectors>'&"

Write debugging information to the standard error file. The selectors are a
sequence of words, separated by plus or minus characters.

.vitem "&%-dbd%& <&'m'&>,<&'s'&>,<&'b'&>"

Write internal debugging data for the contents of bar <&'b'&> (an absolute bar
number) on stave <&'s'&> in movement <&'m'&> to the standard error file. If
only one number is given, it is taken as a bar number in stave 1 of the first
movement; if only two numbers are given, they are taken as a stave and bar
number in the first movement. This option contrains the amount of output that
is produced by &`-d+bar`& (which it implies).

.vitem "&%-dtp%& <&'n'&>"

During formatting, write internal positioning data for bar <&'n'&> (an absolute
bar number) in any movement (there is usually only one when debugging at this
level) to the standard error file. Sometimes a bar may be formatted more than
once; there will be output each time. If the number is given as -1, positioning
data is output for all bars.

.vitem "&%-errormaximum%& <&'number'&>"

.index "errors" "maximum number of"
This option sets the maximum number of errors that may occur before PMW gives
up. The default is 40. This facility is provided mainly so that a test of
errors can generate a large number of them. &%-em%& is an abbreviation for
&%-errormaximum%&.

.vitem "&%-MacOSapp%& <&'directory'&>"

This option is provided for use when PMW is called from within a MacOS
`wrapper' app. It specifies the directory in which all `resources' (such as
font information) are to be found. This is currently an experimental feature.

.vitem "&%-MF%& <&'directory list'&>"

Search the directories in the colon-separated list for the PostScript music
font files, before searching the default directory that was set up when PMW was
installed.

.vitem "&%-SM%& <&'directory'&>"

When looking for `standard macro' files, search the given directory instead of
the one that was set up when PMW was installed.

.vitem "&%-testing%& [<&'number'&>]"

This option is used by the scripts that do automatic testing. It cuts out the
time and version from the output, and also does not include the
standard PSheader file for PostScript. The version information is also omitted
before any error messages. This makes it straightforward to compare the
significant output from different versions of the program. A non-zero value can
be used for fine control of testing behaviour.
.endlist

.index-to I02


.section "Setting default command-line options" SECTsetdefop
.index "options" "command-line, default"
.index "default" "command-line options"
In Unix-like environments there is a simple facility for specifying options
that you always want to be set. This may not be available in other
environments. When PMW starts up, it looks in the user's home directory for a
file called &_.pmwrc_&. If this file exists, its contents are read and used to
modify the PMW command line. White space (spaces, tabs, or newlines) in the
file are used to separate items. Each item is added to the command line, before
the given arguments. Thus, for example, if you always want to make use of the
&%-nowidechars%& option, all you need to do is to create a &_.pmwrc_& file that
contains:
.code
-nowidechars
.endd
The effect of this is the same as if you type &`-nowidechars`& immediately
after &`pmw`& every time you run it. If you insert an option that requires
data, the data item must also be given in the &_.pmwrc_& file, otherwise
an error occurs. For example, if you always want to create MIDI output and
write it to a fixed file name, the file might contain:
.code
-midi /usr/tmp/pmw.mid
.endd
Note that PMW does not allow options to be repeated, so if an option is present
in the &_.pmwrc_& file, it cannot also be given on the command line. There is
no way to override individual options that are set in the &_.pmwrc_& file.
However, if the first option on the command line is &%-norc%& or &%-nopmwrc%&,
the &_.pmwrc_& file is not used.


.section "Information about the piece" SECTinfo
.index "information about the piece"
.index "range of notes on a stave"
.index "staves" "range of notes on"
.index "tessitura"
To understand all of this section, you need to be familiar with the way PMW
handles pitches and dimensions. It is placed here because it follows on from
the command line options, but it is best skipped on a first reading. Here is an
example of the information that is output when &%-v%& is selected:
.code
MOVEMENT 1

Stave  1: 51 bars; range   E'   to  A''  average  A'
Stave  2: 51 bars; range  $B    to  D''  average  E'
Stave  3: 51 bars; range   E'   to  F''  average $B'
Stave  4: 51 bars; range   F`   to  D'   average  D

PAGE LAYOUT

Page 1 bars: 1-4 5-8 (3) 9-12
  Space left on page = 131 Overrun = 61
Page 2 bars: 13-17 18-22 23-25 (10) 26-28
  Space left on page = 5
Page 3 bars: 29-31 32-34 35-38
  Space left on page = 159 Overrun = 33
Page 4 bars: 39-42 (15) 43-46 47-48 49-51
  Space left on page = 5
.endd
For each movement in the piece, PMW displays a bar count for each stave, the
pitch range of notes on the stave, and the average pitch. The count includes
only properly counted bars; if there are any uncounted bars, they are shown in
parentheses with a plus sign. For example, if a piece starts with an uncounted,
incomplete bar, the bar count might be shown as &`24(+1)`&.

The pitches are specified at octave zero, that is, starting at the C below
middle C. The average pitch of a vocal part is some kind of measure of the
tessitura. If there is more than one movement in a piece, the overall pitch
ranges and average pitches for each stave are given at the end.

The `page layout' section shows how PMW has laid out the music on the pages.
In the example above, three systems have been put on page 1, containing bars
1&--4, 5&--8, and 9&--12, respectively. If any system is too short to be
stretched out to the full line length (or if stretching was not requested) an
asterisk follows. After the range of bars for each system, the amount of
horizontal overrun is given in parentheses, provided it is less than 30 points.
The overrun is the distance by which the linelength would be exceeded if
another bar were added to the system. It is rounded up to 0.5 points.

The first line in the example above means that bars 5&--9 were three points too
long for the linelength, which is why the second system was ended after bar 8.
This information can be useful when you are trying to alter the way the bars
are allocated to systems (see also the &%layout%& header directive (&R;
&<<SUBSECTlayout>>&).

`Space left on page' is the amount of vertical space left on the page. It is
the amount by which stave or system spacings can be increased without causing
the bottom system to be moved over to the next page. `Overrun' is the amount of
extra space that is needed to fit another system onto the page. It is the
amount by which stave or system spacings would have to be reduced in order for
the first system of the next page to be brought back onto the bottom of this
page. It is not shown if the value is greater than 100 or if the page break was
forced.


.section "PMW input errors"
.index "input errors"
.index "errors" "in input"
When PMW detects an error in the input file, it writes a message to the
standard error file. In most cases it carries on processing the input file, so
that as many errors as possible are detected in the run. As is the case in many
programming languages, certain kinds of error can cause it to get confused and
give misleading subsequent messages. If you do not understand all the error
messages, fix those that you do, and try again. It is very easy to make simple
typographic errors that leave a bar with the wrong number of notes in it. An
example of the message that PMW outputs is as follows:
.code
** Error: incorrect bar length: too long by 1 quaver
   Detected near line 24 of K495.pmw
rrf'-g |
-------->
.endd
In this case a minus sign (indicating a quaver) has been omitted after the note
&`g`&, which is therefore taken as a crotchet. The input line in which the
error was detected is shown, and the character `>' is output underneath the
position where the error was detected. In this example, PMW has just reached
the bar line. The line number is given using the phrase `near line &'n'&'
because sometimes PMW has read on to the next line before detecting the error.

Most errors cause PMW to stop processing before it writes anything to the main
output, in which case there is a final message `&`** No output generated`&.'
However, there are a few errors that do not stop the output from being written.
An example is the detection of a bar that is too wide for the page; PMW
diagnoses this, and then squashes it to fit. The messages for all these errors
start with the word `warning'.


.section "Return codes"
.index "return codes"
PMW gives the C return code &`EXIT_SUCCESS`& (which is normally zero) when it
has successfully generated some output, even if one or more warnings were
given. Otherwise, it returns &`EXIT_FAILURE`& (which is normally 1).





. ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

.chapter "Processing PMW output" CHAPpmwoutput
.index "PDF" "viewing"
.index "viewing music on screen"
Any available PDF viewer, including many browsers, should be able to display or
print a PDF produced by PMW using the &%-pdf%& option, because PMW always
includes its music font and any additional text fonts within the PDF. For
PostScript output, however, it is a bit more complicated because PMW's music
font has to be made available to the processing software. If you are using PDF
output, you can ignore the next three sections.


.section "PostScript processors"
.index &'GhostScript'&
.index "&(evince)& document viewer"
.index "PDF" "conversion from PostScript"
&'GhostScript'& is an application for processing PostScript. It can display it
on the screen or convert it to a PDF via its &(ps2pdf)& command. Such a PDF is
uaually smaller than a PDF written directly by PMW because &'GhostScript'& can
disassemble fonts and include only those characters that are actually used,
whereas PMW includes entire fonts in its PDF output. Other document
viewers such as &(evince)& make use of &'GhostScript'& when processing
PostScript files.

Any PostScript processor must have access to the PMW-Music font when handling
PMW output files. If it cannot find a font, it makes a substitution, which in
the case of the music font usually results in nonsense. One easy way to ensure
the availability of the music font is to use the &%-incPMWfont%& option, which
causes the music font to be included within the PostScript output (&R;
&<<SECTincpmw>>&). Alternatively, you can set up &'GhostScript'& so that it
knows where to find the music font (&R; &<<SECTsetup>>&).

&'GhostScript's'& basic &(gs)& command writes information about which fonts it
is using to the standard output, but it is quite primitive, being controlled
via the command line. A more friendly interface is provided by front-end
`wrapper' applications such as &(gv)& or &(evince)&, which have the added
advantage of showing thumbnails of all the pages.


.section "Including music fonts in the PostScript file" SECTincpmw
.index "fonts" "including in the output"
.index "music font, including in the output"
If you use the &%-incPMWfont%& option on the &(pmw)& command line, or put it in
your &_.pmwrc_& file, or use the &%incPMWfont%& directive in your input file,
PMW includes the PostScript Type 1 version of the PMW-Music font and/or the
PMW-Alpha font in every output file that needs them. The resulting files are
freestanding PostScript files that should be printable or viewable without the
need to take any action concerning the music fonts. However, PostScript Type 1
fonts are gradually becoming obsolete, so this facility should be used with
caution. Also, the files are larger by about 30&--40K for each of the two
fonts. It is not possible to embed the OpenType version of PMW-Music within a
PostScript program.


.section "Setting up for &'GhostScript'&" SECTsetup
.index &'GhostScript'&
.index "&(evince)& document viewer"
.index "PDF" "conversion from PostScript"
If you do not use the &%-incPMWfont%& option, &'GhostScript'& needs to be told
where the PostScript music fonts are before it can correctly display a
PostScript output file or convert it into a PDF. The easiest way of doing this
is to set the &`GS_FONTPATH`& environment variable, for example:
.code
export GS_FONTPATH=/usr/local/share/pmw/psfonts
.endd
A more complicated alternative is to install symbolic links from a suitable
font directory to PMW's &_psfonts_& directory. You can find out which
directories &'GhostScript'& searches for its fonts by running the following
command:
.code
gs -h
.endd
For example, if &_/usr/share/fonts/gsfonts_& is in the `search path' given by
the above command, you might use these commands for the PMW-Music font:
.code
ln -s /usr/local/share/pmw/psfonts/PMW-Music.pfa \
      /usr/share/fonts/gsfonts/PMW-Music.pfa
ln -s /usr/local/share/pmw/psfonts/PMW-Music.otf \
      /usr/share/fonts/gsfonts/PMW-Music.otf
.endd
Similarly, if you are going to make use of the PMW-Alpha font:
.code
ln -s /usr/local/share/pmw/psfonts/PMW-Alpha.pfa \
      /usr/share/fonts/gsfonts/PMW-Alpha.pfa
ln -s /usr/local/share/pmw/psfonts/PMW-Alpha.otf \
      /usr/share/fonts/gsfonts/PMW-Alpha.otf
.endd
Using either of these methods should enable &'GhostScript'& and other viewers
such as &(evince)& that make use of it to process PMW's PostScript output
correctly.


.section "Watching a changing file"
&'GhostScript'& and &(evince)& can display both PDF and PostScript output
files. The &(gv)& command has an option called &%-watch%& that causes the file
to be re-displayed whenever it changes. This happens automatically for
&(evince)&. If you leave one of these viewers running, you can edit the input
and reprocess it with PMW, and the viewer will automatically display the new
output.


.section "Problems with displaying staves and bar lines"
.index "staves" "incorrectly displayed"
.index "bar lines" "incorrectly displayed"
By default, staves and bar lines are output using characters from PMW's music
font. Some PostScript/PDF interpreters do not display these correctly on the
screen, and sometimes there are also printing problems. To help with these
issues, the way PMW works can be modified by command line options (&R;
&<<CHAPrunningpmw>>&). If your output does not show staves or bar lines
correctly, experiment with these options to see if they can resolve the issue.
Note that default option settings can be put in your &_.pmwrc_& file.

.subsection "Missing staves"
.index "screen display" "missing staves"
.index "staves" "missing"
Staves are normally output using two characters that are 100 points and 10
points wide, respectively, at the default magnification. Some PostScript/PDF
interpreters cannot handle characters as wide as 100 points, and either display
nothing, or give errors. The &%-nowidechars%& option suppresses the use of the
wide characters. There is also a &%nowidechars%& directive that can be included
in your input file.

.subsection "Gaps in staves"
.index "screen display" "gaps in staves"
Sometimes PMW output is displayed with gaps in the staves, even when
&%-nowidechars%& is used to suppress the use of wide stave characters. This is
sometimes just a problem with a screen display; the same file often prints
correctly. If the option &%-drawstavelines%& is used, staves are output as
drawing commands instead of as characters. This option overrides
&%-nowidechars%&.  There is also a &%drawstavelines%& directive that can be
included in your input file.

.subsection "Gaps in bar lines"
.index "screen display" "gaps in bar lines"
Sometimes PMW output is displayed with gaps in bar lines that extend over
several staves. This is sometimes just a problem with a screen display; the
same file often prints correctly. If the option &%-drawbarlines%& is used, bar
lines are output as drawing commands instead of as characters. There is also a
&%drawbarlines%& directive that can be included in your input file.


.section "Printing PMW output"

In modern Unix-like environments, the CUPS printing system is usually set up to
handle PDF and PostScript files automatically, so it you can display a PMW
output file on the screen, it should print without problems.

.chapter "Getting started with PMW encoding" CHAPfirstintro
In this and the next chapter we cover the basic facilities of the way PMW input
is encoded, omitting some of the more exotic features in order to keep the
explanations simple. Full information is given in the reference section of this
manual, which starts at chapter &<<CHAPreference>>&. We start with a file that
contains the first few bars of &'Happy Birthday'&.
.code
heading "|Happy Birthday"
breakbarlines
underlaysize 9.5
notespacing *1.1
key F
time 3/4
unfinished

[stave 1 treble 1 text underlay]
"Hap-py birth-day to you, hap-py birth-day to you. Hap-py"
[nocheck nocount] c-.; c= |
dcf | E c-.; c= | dcg | F c-.; c= |
[endstave]

[stave 2 bass 0]
[nocheck] r | F. | C. | c d e | F. |
[endstave]
.endd
Let's suppose the file is called &_bday_&. If you have PMW installed, you can
process such a file by running this command:
.code
pmw -pdf bday
.endd
If there are no errors in the notation, there will be no output on the
screen, but a new file called &_bday.pdf_& will have been created. The &%-pdf%&
option overrides PMW's default output format. You should be able to open the
PDF with any available PDF viewer. If you want to test PostScript output, run
.code
pmw -ps -ipf bday
.endd
This will make a file called &_bday.ps_& which includes PMW's music font
(requested by the &%-ipf%& option). This output can be viewed using a
PostScript viewer such as &'GhostScript'&, using its &(gs)& command or a
wrapper such as &(gv)& or &(evince)&. See chapter &<<CHAPpmwoutput>>& for more
details about handling PostScript output. In both the PDF and PostScript cases,
the output should display this:

.music music01 88 0,-22 centre

If there are errors in the input file, one or more messages will be written to
the standard error file, and should therefore appear on your screen. The
messages should be self-explanatory. Correct the error(s), and try again.

We now explain what the different parts of this input file mean to PMW. The
data is in two parts: first there is header information, such as the textual
heading and key and time signatures for the piece, and then the music for each
stave is given separately. The header in this example contains seven &'header
directives'&. They have been put on separate lines for readability, but this is
not a requirement; you can have several directives on one line if you like.

.code
heading "|Happy Birthday"
.endd
.index "| (vertical bar) in strings"
The first directive provides a text heading for the piece. The text itself must
be supplied inside double quote marks. Heading lines normally consist of a left
part, a centred part, and a right part. The division between these is marked by
a vertical bar character in the text. This example outputs nothing at the left
(because there is nothing before the vertical bar), and nothing at the right
(because there isn't a second vertical bar). In other words, the entire title
is centred.

.code
breakbarlines
.endd
.index "&%breakbarlines%&"
The second directive causes PMW to make a break in the bar lines after each
stave. Without this, the bar lines would be drawn continuously from the top of
the first stave to the bottom of the second. It is conventional not to have bar
lines between staves when there is vocal underlay (lyrics), as they can get in
the way of the words. In orchestral scores you may want to have bar line breaks
between different groups of instruments, and this can be achieved by listing
the stave numbers after which you want the breaks:
.code
breakbarlines 4, 8, 12
.endd
This breaks the bar lines after staves 4, 8, and 12.

.code
underlaysize 9.5
.endd
The third directive sets the font size for the underlay text (the sung words).
Font sizes are given in &'points'&, the traditional measure of type size used
by printers.
.index "default" "text size"
.index "text" "default size"
The default size for all text attached to a stave is 10 points; choosing a
slightly smaller size for underlay is often helpful in fitting in the words.

&*Note*&: The music above and in all the following examples in this manual is
shown at 0.85 times its normal size, so the type sizes you see here are smaller
than they will be if you process the example yourself.

.code
notespacing *1.1
.endd
The fourth directive is an instruction to PMW to increase its normal horizontal
note spacing by a factor of 1.1 (the asterisk is being used as a multiplication
symbol). The standard note spacing is suitable for instrumental music. When
vocal underlay is involved, it often improves the layout if the spacing is
increased by a factor of between 1.1 and 1.2.

PMW automatically increases the space between two notes in a bar if this is
necessary to avoid two underlaid syllables colliding, but if this happens a
lot, the spacing of the notes can look very strange. It is best to set the note
spacing sufficiently wide that most of the layout is determined by the music,
with only the occasional adjustment for the words.

.code
key F
.endd
The fifth directive sets the key signature. If no key signature is given, C
major is assumed. Minor keys are given by adding the letter `m', for example,
&`Am`&. Sharp and flat key signatures are given using the standard accidental
notation in PMW. A sharp is represented by the character &`#`&, which is easily
remembered. Unfortunately, there are no keys on the computer keyboard that
resemble flats or naturals, so instead the two keys that are next to &`#`& on
some keyboards were chosen: &`$`& for a flat (think `dollar' for `down') and
&`%`& for a natural. For example, the key signatures C sharp minor and G flat
major are coded as &`C#m`& and &`G$`& respectively.

.code
time 3/4
.endd
The sixth directive sets the time signature. If no time signature is given, 4/4
is assumed. As well as the usual numeric time signatures, the letters &`C`& and
&`A`& can be given, signifying `common' and `alla breve' time. These are
output as &{{^}}& and &{{_}}& respectively.

.code
unfinished
.endd
The final directive tells PMW that this is not a complete piece of music; this
stops it from putting a thick bar line at the end. The header ends and the
stave data begins with the first line that starts with a square bracket:
.code
[stave 1 treble 1 text underlay]
.endd
You will notice that a bit further down there is a line containing just
&%[endstave]%&. This marks the end of the data for the first stave. Each
stave's data is always contained between &%[stave]%& and &%[endstave]%&.

The data itself consists of a mixture of encoded music, words, bar lines, and
so on, and also &'stave directives'&. To make it clear what is what, the stave
directives are enclosed in square brackets, and they are shown in brackets
whenever they are mentioned in this manual. Several stave directives can appear
in succession within a single pair of brackets.

The number following the word `stave' in the &%[stave]%& directive gives the
number of the stave. The top stave of a system is numbered 1, the next one down
is numbered 2, and so on. PMW can handle up to 63 staves in a system. Usually,
a clef-setting directive comes next, as in both staves of this example, where
the first stave uses the treble clef and the second stave the bass clef. The
number that follows the clef name sets the &'current octave'& for the notes of
the stave. PMW octaves run from C up to B, and octave number 1 starts at middle
C. It is usual, therefore, to set the current octave to 1 when using the treble
clef, and to 0 when using the bass clef, as has been done here.

The remaining stave directive, &`text`& &`underlay`&, sets the default type for
any text strings in the first stave. PMW supports several different kinds of
text, as we shall see later, and one of them can be set as the default for a
stave. Instances of strings of other types then have to be marked as such. When
a stave has vocal underlay in it, it is usual to set the default as above,
because by far the majority of the text will be underlay. So at last we come to
the music and words of the first stave:

.code
"Hap-py birth-day to you, hap-py birth-day to you. Hap-py"
[nocheck nocount] c-. c= |
d c f | E c-. c= | d c g | F c-. c= |
.endd

.index "underlay"
The vocal underlay is given as a text string preceding the notes to which it
relates. You can split up underlay into strings that are as long or as short as
you like. PMW automatically distributes the syllables to the notes that follow.
Single hyphens are used to separate the different syllables of the words, as in
`hap-py' and `birth-day'. PMW supplies as many hyphens as necessary to fill the
space between them on the page. Text strings are not restricted to just the
characters on the computer keyboard; see section &<<SUBSECTescaped>>& for
details of how to access other characters.

The music itself is divided up into bars by the vertical bar character. PMW
checks that the contents of a bar agree with the time signature, and complains
if there are too many or too few notes. It is possible to turn this check off,
and this has been done for the first bar by including &%[nocheck]%& (you can
also turn it off for the whole piece). The first bar also contains
&%[nocount]%& because it is conventional not to include an `upbeat' bar at the
start of a piece in bar numbering (&R; &<<SUBSECTbarnumbers>>&).

.index "notes" "pitch"
.index "pitch of note"
The notes are encoded using their familiar letter names. Because we set the
current octave to be octave 1, the letter &`c`& in the first bar represents
middle C. To raise a note by an octave it is followed by a quote character, so
&`c'`& would give the C above middle C. A note can be lowered an octave by
following its letter with a grave accent.

.index "length" "of notes"
The duration of a note is primarily determined by whether a capital (upper
case) letter or small (lower case) letter is used. A lower case letter stands
for a crotchet, and an upper case one is used for a minim, as in the third bar
of this stave. Further characters are used to adjust the duration: a minus sign
(hyphen) after a lower case letter turns the crotchet into a quaver, the hyphen
being mnemonically like the flag used to distinguish a quaver from a crotchet.
.index "notes" "dotted"
A dotted note is coded by adding a full stop, as in the first, third, and
fifth bars. An equals sign (two flags) signifies a semiquaver. Sequences of
notes that are shorter than a crotchet are automatically beamed together unless
separated by a semicolon (&R; &<<SUBSECTbeams>>&). The convention in vocal
parts is not to beam notes that are sung to different syllables, which is why
semicolons are used here.

The only new feature in the second stave is the use of the letter &`r`& for a
rest. This example has no accidentals, but if you need one, it is entered
before the note letter (just as accidentals are written before notes). The
characters used for accidentals were described above when discussing key
signatures, but to remind you:

.itable none 0 0 2  12 left  100 left
.row &`#`&  "is used for a sharp"
.row &`$`&  "is used for a flat"
.row &`%`&  "is used for a natural"
.endtable

Should you need double sharps or double flats, just type the character twice.
PMW also has support for half accidentals (&R; &<<SUBSECThalfaccs>>&).

The spacing used in this example was chosen to make it easy to read. PMW does
not require spaces to appear between notes or before bar lines, so the
bars of the second stave could equally well appear like this:
.code
[nocheck]r|F.|C.|cde|F.|
.endd
However, spaces must not be used between any of the characters that make up the
encoding for one note. For example, &`#`&&~&`c`& would not be recognized
because of the space between the &`#`& and the &`c`&. Normally, you should put
in spaces where it helps you to see the various items in a bar. Wherever one
space is allowed, you may put as many as you like. You may also start a new
line in the input at most places where a space is allowed, for example, between
notes, or between text strings and notes. Most people try not to have a line
break in the middle of the notes of a bar, as this makes the file easier to
read.

.index "@ (comment) character"
.index "annotating input"
When you start entering longer pieces, you may find it helpful to annotate the
input file to make it easier to find your way around it. PMW recognizes the
character &`@`& as a `comment character' &-- anything on an input line that
follows &`@`& is completely ignored. So, for example, you could have a line
such as:
.code
@ This is the pedal part
.endd
at the start of a stave. It is also a good idea to put a bar number in the
input at the end of each input line, and some people even like to keep each bar
on a separate line like this:
.code
[nocheck] r | @0
F. | @1
C. | @2
c d e | @3
F. | @4
.endd

In the next chapter we will introduce other features of the PMW encoding, but
without showing the complete file every time. It particular, the &%[stave]%&
and &%[endstave]%& directives will normally be omitted. However, before doing
that we introduce a general feature that can be used to simplify and customise
PMW input files.


.section "Simple macros" SECTmacro
.index "macros" "definition"
.index "macros" "insertion"
A &'macro'& is a concept found in computer programming languages and in some
kinds of wordprocessing systems. The idea is very simple: whenever there is a
sequence of input characters that are going to be repeated several times in a
document, the sequence is given a name. Referring to the name later in the
input calls up the required characters. There are several advantages in using a
macro for a repeated character sequence. Not only does it save typing, but it
also guarantees that the same input string is used every time, thus ensuring
consistency. In addition, if a change needs to be made to the string, it only
has to be done once.

Simple macros are introduced here because they are conveniently used for text
strings such as &'mf'&, or &'ff'& which may appear many times in a piece. A
macro definition can specify exactly how you would like such a string to appear
&-- what size, which font, etc. Several files of `standard macros' are provided
with PMW (&R; &<<CHAPstdmacs>>&). These contain basic macros for dynamics,
fingering, figured bass text, and more. There are also a number of macros
contributed by users in the &_contrib_& directory of the distribution tarball.
As a brief introduction to macros, consider the following input line:
.code
*define mf "\it\m\bi\f"/b
.endd
.index "&%*define%&"
This is a directive that defines a macro whose name is &%mf%&. It is an example
of a &'preprocessing directive'&, which is a third kind of directive, in
addition to header directives and stave directives. Preprocessing directives
may occur anywhere in a PMW input file. They always occupy a complete input
line by themselves, and are identified by starting with an asterisk. The
&%*define%& directive must be followed by the name of the macro being defined.
The replacement text for the macro consists of the rest of the input line,
which may be empty. White space that immediately follows the macro name is not
included.

.index "&& (insert) character"
After the definition above has been processed, an occurrence of the characters
&`&&mf`& anywhere in the input is replaced by the text &`"\it\m\bi\f"/b`&.
There must not be any space between the introductory &`&&`& character and the
name of the macro that is being inserted. This particular example specifies a
text item for the string &'m&*f*&'&, where the &'m'& is in italic and the
&*&'f'&*& in bold italic, as is commonly done. (See sections
&<<SUBSECTspecfont>>& and &<<SECTtextstrings>>& for explanations of how the
above string achieves this.) The example also specifies that the string is to
be positioned below the stave. If other options are needed for instances of the
string, they can be added after the macro call; in particular, adding &`/a`&
will cause the text to be above the stave, because when both &`/b`& and &`/a`&
appear, the rightmost one is used. Here are some examples of possible uses of
this macro:
.code
&mf abc | &mf/a efg | cg &mf/d6 d |
.endd
The option &`/d6`& moves the text down by six points. Macros can be used for
any string of input characters; their use is not confined to text items. A full
description of all the macro facilities is given in section
&<<SECTpreprocess>>&.




. ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
. ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

.chapter "Using other PMW features" CHAPlastintro
In this chapter we cover most of the major PMW facilities in an introductory
manner. All the information is repeated in more detail in the reference
chapters that follow.

.section "More about notes"
This section describes some more common facilities related to notes.

.subsection "Note types"
.index "notes" "types of"
.index "flags"
PMW can handle eight different kinds of note, from breves to
hemi-demi-semiquavers. The encoding for some of them was introduced in the
previous chapter. For notes longer than a minim the plus character is used to
double the duration, and for those shorter than a semiquaver, the minus and
equals characters can be combined. The complete set is as follows:

.music "music02" 36 0,-14

If a stave consists mostly of notes that are shorter than a crotchet, some
typing can be saved by the use of the &%[halvenotes]%& stave directive, which
halves the length of subsequent notes. For more detail see section
&<<SUBSECTstavehalvenotes>>&.


.subsection "Rests"
.index "rests"
.index "whole bar rests"
Rests are specified in the same way as notes, but using the letter R instead of
a note letter. The length of the rest is indicated by the case of the letter
and following plus, minus, or equals characters, exactly as for notes. There is
one additional character that can follow the letter R, and that is an
exclamation mark. This indicates that the rest is equal to the bar length,
whatever the time signature may be. See section &<<SUBSECTrests>>& for details
about other special types of rest.


.subsection "Repeated rest bars"
.index "repeated rest bars"
.index "rests" "repeated bars"
.index "repeated bars"
.index "many bars rest"
A whole bar rest can be repeated any number of times by putting a number in
square brackets before the rest. For example, the code for 24 bars' rest is:
.code
[24] R! |
.endd
In fact, this kind of repetition is not confined to rest bars; it can be used
to repeat any one bar. It is also possible to repeat sequences of more than one
bar (&R; &<<SUBSECTstringrepetition>>&).


.subsection "Beams" SUBSECTbeams
.index "beaming" "breaking a beam"
.index "beaming" "across rests"
.index "notes" "beaming"
.index "rests" "beaming across"
.index "semicolon" "beam breaking"
.index "; (semicolon)" "beam breaking"
.index "comma" "beam breaking"
.index ", (comma)" "beam breaking"
Notes that are shorter than a crotchet are automatically beamed together within
a bar, except when a note is followed by a beam breaking character. A semicolon
breaks the beaming completely, whereas a comma breaks all but the outermost
beam. Beams carry on across rests that are shorter than a crotchet, but they
are always broken at the end of a bar, unless a continuation over the bar line
is explicitly requested (&R; &<<SECTbeaming>>&.)

.music music03 40 0,-10 centre

White space is permitted between the last note of a beam and any breaking
character (semicolon or comma).


.subsection "Triplets"
.index "irregular note groups"
Triplets are encoded by enclosing a set of notes in curly brackets. If the
notes are beamed, just the number `3' appears alongside the beam. Otherwise, a
longways `bracket' is drawn:

.music music04 46 0,-8 centre

You can change the way triplets are handled by putting options after the
opening curly bracket. If you put &`/a`& the `3' will be put above the notes,
whereas &`/b`& forces it below the notes. In both cases the longways bracket
is also drawn.

.music music05 48 0,-6 centre

The last set of notes shows that triplets are beamed onto adjoining notes
unless a beam breaking character is present. PMW supports other irregular note
groupings as well as triplets, and has several more options for controlling the
form and placing of the mark (&R; &<<SUBSECTtupletfont>>&,
&<<SUBSECTtupletlinewidth>>&, &<<SUBSECTtupletintro>>&, &<<SUBSECTtuplets>>&).


.subsection "Accents and ornaments"
.index "accents" "on notes"
.index "expression marks"
.index "notes" "accents"
.index "notes" "expression"
The coding for accents and ornaments is always placed between two backslash
characters immediately following a note. For example, a note with a staccato
dot is followed by &`\.\`&. The most common accents and ornaments are:

.music music06 78 0,-12 centre

The codes &`\v\`& and &`\V\`& are used for small and large `vertical wedge'
accents because of the similarity of shape, though the accents themselves may
be the opposite way up to the coding letters, depending on whether they appear
above or below the note. The other mark that looks like the letter V is a
string `up bow' mark, which is why &`\u\`& is used to represent it.

Other controlling options are also given between the same pair of backslash
characters. For example, to force the stem of a note to point upwards or
downwards, the encodings &`\su\`& or &`\sd\`& are used, respectively. When
there is more than one item between the backslashes, spaces may be used to
separate them. Details of all the various options are given in several sections
from &<<SUBSECTnoteexpr>>& onwards.


.subsection "Chords"
.index "chords" "specifying"
Chords in which all the notes are the same length are encoded by enclosing a
number of separate notes in round brackets (parentheses). If the chord has an
accent, or any other special option, this must be given with the first note.
The notes can be given in any order.

.music music07 42 0,-10 centre


.section "Bar lengths and bar numbers" SECTbarlennum
.index "bar lengths"
.index "variable bar lengths"
.index "odd bar lengths"
.index "length" "of bars"
PMW checks that the notes given for a bar match the current time signature, and
generates an error message if they do not. However, there are times when this
checking needs to be disabled. For a piece that has variable-length bars
without time signatures, or indeed for typesetting the kind of examples that
appear in this manual, the checking can be entirely suppressed by using the
header directive &%nocheck%&. The length check can also be disabled for an
individual bar. This is done by using the &%[nocheck]%& stave directive in the
bar concerned, in each stave. The most common occurrence of this is at the
start or end of a piece where there is an incomplete bar.

If there is more than one stave, PMW checks that each one has the same note
length in each bar. If not, it generates a warning message for each mismatch.
Output is still generated; the short bars are filled with blank space.
.index "whole bar rests"
.index "rests" "whole bar, length check"
However, this check does not apply to whole bar rests that are notated using an
exclamation mark (&`R!`&), unless the bar ends with something else (such as a
clef change) that depends on the bar length. This exception is made so that the
whole bar rest notation can conveniently be used in situations where the bars
in the other staves are of varying lengths.
.index "MIDI" "whole bar rests"
If a MIDI file is generated, whole bar rests always take up the length of time
implied by the time signature.



.subsection "Bar numbers" SUBSECTbarnumbers
.index "bar numbers" "requesting"
.index "numbering bars"
The &%barnumbers%& header directive is used to request automatic bar numbering
above the top stave of systems. There are several options that control where
the numbers appear and in what form.
.code
barnumbers line
.endd
This causes PMW to output a bar number at the start of each line of music,
except for the first line.
.code
barnumbers 10
.endd
This causes PMW to output a bar number every 10 bars. You can choose any number
you like; specifying 1 causes every bar to be numbered. If the word `boxed' or
`roundboxed' appears after the directive name, the numbers are enclosed in a
rectangular box with mitred or round corners, respectively. You may also
specify the point size of the font after the word `line' or the count.
.code
barnumbers boxed line 9
.endd
This requests bar numbers at the start of each line, in boxes, using a 9-point
font. The default font size is 10 points. Finally, you can specify the font to
be used for the number:
.code
barnumbers 5 italic
.endd
This requests bar numbers in italic, every five bars, using the default font
size of 10 points. There are further options for forcing or suppressing
individual bar numbers, and for moving them (&R; &<<SUBSECTstavebarno>>&).


.subsection "Bar counting" SUBSECTbarcounting
.index "bar counting"
.index "bar numbers" "counting"
.index "counting bars"
When a piece starts with an incomplete bar, it is conventional not to count it
for bar-numbering purposes. Bar number 1 is normally the first complete bar of
the piece. PMW does not do this automatically, but it does have the
&%[nocount]%& stave directive, which causes a bar not to be counted for
numbering purposes. This can be used anywhere in the piece, not only in the
first bar. Section &<<SECTident>>& explains how PMW identifies uncounted bars
if it needs to refer to them, for example, in an error message.
The following example shows the use of the &%barnumbers%&, &%[nocheck]%&, and
&%[nocount]%& directives:
.code
barnumbers boxed 2 italic
time 4/4
[stave 1 treble 1]
[nocount nocheck]
b`-; c-d- | e.d-; e-a-g-e- | d-c-a`.c-; e-f- | @2
g. a-; g-e-c-e- | Dr-; b`-; c-d- | @4
.endd

.music music08 40 0,-18 centre


.section "More about underlay (lyrics)"
.index "text" "underlay"
.index "underlay" "multiple notes per syllable"
PMW supports overlay (words above the stave) as well as underlay, though this
is much less common. To avoid too many repetitions of `underlay or overlay',
this manual mainly describes underlay, on the understanding that all the
facilities are also available for overlay.


.subsection "Multi-note syllables"
In the example in chapter &<<CHAPfirstintro>>&, each syllable of the underlay
was associated with just one note. When this is not the case, equals characters
are used to continue a syllable over as many notes as necessary.
.code
"glo-========ri-a in=="
a-e-a- | b-c'=b=a=b= | c'-c'-b- | g-a-b- |
.endd

.music music09 40 10,-10

If the continued syllable is not the last one in a word, the equals characters
follow the hyphen. PMW outputs a string of hyphens or an extender line, as
appropriate, depending on whether the syllable is at the end of a word or not.
PMW does not treat tied notes specially when distributing underlaid syllables
to notes, and so an equals character must be used when a syllable is associated
with a tied note. An underlay string must be followed by all the notes to which
it relates. This includes continued notes that are indicated by equals
characters. Consider the following example:
.code
"the cat sat=" g- | gg_ |
"on the mat"  ge-f- | gr |
.endd
This example is not correct, because the first string provides words for four
notes (three syllables plus a continuation), but only three notes follow before
the next string. If, as in this example, you start another underlay string
before the previous one is all used up, the second string is treated as a
second verse and is positioned underneath the first string.


.subsection "Special characters and font changes" SUBSECTspecfont
The computer keyboard does not contain all the characters that are needed for
underlay, and there is often a requirement to use different fonts (for example,
italic). To cope with these issues, PMW treats the backslash character
specially if it is found in a quoted string. (This applies to all strings, not
just underlay.) Backslash is known as the `escape character' because it allows
an escape from the string in order to give some control information.
.index "\ (escape) character"
.index "escaped characters"
.index "backslash"
There are a number of `escape sequences' that allow you to specify characters
that may not be directly available on the keyboard:

.itable none 0 0 2  40 left  200 left
.row &`\a'`&  "outputs &aacute;"
.row &`\a``&  "outputs &agrave;"
.row &`\a.`&  "outputs &auml;"
.row &`\a^`&  "outputs &acirc;"
.row &`\ss`&  "outputs &szlig;"
.endtable

.index "accented characters in strings"
For example, the input string &`"\it\sch\o.ner"`& becomes &'sch&ouml;ner'&.
Using such escapes makes it possible to encode any character using only ASCII
codes. However, PMW does also recognize UTF-8 encoding in character strings.
Changes of font are specified by giving a two-letter font code between a pair
of backslashes:

.itable none 0 0 2  40 left  200 left
.row &`\it\`&   "change to &'italic'&"
.row &`\rm\`&   "change to roman"
.row &`\bf\`&   "change to &*bold face*&"
.row &`\bi\`&   "change to &*&'bold italic'&*&"
.endtable

.index "font changes"
There is an in-depth discussion of text fonts and character encodings in
section &<<SUBSECTuniutf>>&. Section &<<SUBSECTescaped>>& has more details
about escape sequences, and there is a list of available text characters and
their escape sequences in chapter &<<CHAPunifont>>&.



.subsection "Spacing" SUBSECTunderlayspacing
.index "underlay" "spacing"
.index "spacing" "underlay"
Within a bar, PMW ensures that the syllables of underlay text do not crash into
each other, by spreading out the notes if necessary. &*Warning:*& If use of the
&%layout%& header directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTlayout>>&) causes the bars in a
system to be horizontally compressed in order to fit them on the line,
underlaid syllables may be forced into each other. It's best to avoid settings
of &%layout%& that cause compression if possible.

Sometimes you may want to make additional adjustments to the spacing. The
&%[space]%& directive is used to insert additional space between notes. The
units used for space in PMW are &'printers' points'&, of which there are 72 to
the inch.
.code
a [space 7] b
.endd
This coding ensures that the two notes are 7 points (about 0.1 of an inch)
further apart than they would otherwise be. Any underlay that is attached to
the notes is also moved appropriately.
.index "# character in underlay"
.index "^ character" "in underlay"
.index "circumflex" "in underlay"
There are also two facilities for altering the position of an underlay syllable
relative to its note. Firstly, the character &`#`&, if it appears in an
underlay string, is replaced by a space, but is treated as part of a syllable.
Since syllables are centred on their notes, putting &`#`& characters at the
start of a syllable moves it to the right, and putting them at the end moves it
left. Secondly, if the character &`^`& appears in an underlay syllable, only
those characters to the left of it are used for finding the centre of the
string; the character itself is not output. The &`#`& and &`^`& characters are
treated specially only in underlay (and overlay) strings. This example shows
how the use of &`#`& and &`^`& affects the positioning of syllables:
.code
"music ###music music### mu^sic" G+ G+ G+ G+
.endd

.music music10 30 8,-14


.section "Other kinds of text"
.index "text" "on staves"
Text strings that are not part of the underlay are normally followed by one of
the options &`/a`& or &`/b`&, indicating that the string is not underlay, and
that it is to be placed above or below the stave, respectively. If &%[text
underlay]%& has not been set for the stave, unqualified strings are treated as
if &`/b`& were present. Such strings are normally aligned so that they start at
the position of the following note, or at the bar line if there are no
following notes in the bar. However, if the option &`/e`& is given, the string
is aligned so as to end at the subsequent note or bar line.

The position of any string can be adjusted by following it by one or more of
the options &`/u`& (up), &`/d`& (down), &`/l`& (left), or &`/r`& (right) and a
number, which is a distance in printers' points. It is also possible to adjust
the horizontal position by reference to the musical offset (&R;
&<<SECThorizalign>>&). The initial font for non-underlay strings is italic,
but the escape sequences described above can be used to change it as necessary.
Here are some examples:

.code
"X"/a g "X"/a/u4 g "X"/a/l6 g |
"rall."/a gab | "\bi\ff"/b A. |
G. "\rm\May, 1994"/b/e |
.endd

.music music11 40 8,-16

Music characters (such as notes) are available for use in strings, and there
are a number of escape sequences for the most common cases.

.itable none 0 0 2  40 left  200 left
.row &`\*m\`&   "outputs a minim"
.row &`\*c\`&   "outputs a crotchet"
.endtable

.index "notes" "in text strings"
These are most useful in strings of the form &`"\*c\ \rm\= 45"`&, which
becomes:

.display
&{5}& = 45
.endd


.index "rehearsal marks"
A rehearsal mark is a special kind of string that is coded by placing it in
square brackets:
.code
["A"]
.endd
PMW outputs such strings in a fairly large font, enclosed in a rectangular box;
there are options to change these settings (&R; &<<SECTrehearse>>&).


.section "Ties, slurs, and glissandos" SECTtiesslurs
.index "ties"  "specifying"
.index "slurs" "introduction"
.index "glissandos"
Single notes and chords are tied together by entering an underscore character
at the end of the first note, or following the closing parenthesis of the first
chord. For single notes, ties are normally drawn on the opposite side of the
noteheads from the stems, but can be followed by &`/a`& or &`/b`& to force them
above or below the noteheads. These options can also be used for chords.

.music music12 44 0,-4 centre

When two single notes of different pitches are connected by a slur, the same
notation (an underscore) can be used. However, for chords, the &%[slur]%&
directive (see below) is required to draw slurs, because if two chords are
joined by an underscore, the notes in each that are of the same pitch are
joined by a tie mark, any other notes being left alone. An underscore is also
used for glissandos between single notes; following it with &`/g`& causes a
glissando line to be drawn instead of a short slur.

.music music13 40 0,-10

For slurs involving chords or covering more than two notes, the &%[slur]%& and
&%[endslur]%& (or &%[es]%&) directives are used. The notes that are to be
covered by the slur appear between them. The slur is drawn above the notes
unless &`/b`& is given.
.code
[slur]
  d-. [slur] d=_; d=c=a-; [es]
  [slur/b] %d'\-\ a-\sd\ b_b- [es]
[endslur]
.endd

.music music14 40 8,-10

This example shows that slurs can be `nested' inside one another if necessary,
each &%[endslur]%& directive relating to the most recent &%[slur]%&. There are
options for handling more complicated cases, and there are also options for
adjusting the positions and shapes of slurs, and for introducing gaps (&R;
&<<SUBSECTslurs>>&).


.section "Repeats" SECTrepeats
.index "repeat marks"
.index "first time bar"
Conventional musical repeat marks are encoded using the input strings &`(:`&
and &`:)`& which may occur in the middle of a bar as well as at the start or
end. A number of different mark styles are available (&R;
&<<SUBSECTrepeatstyle>>&). When there is a first time and a second time ending,
the directives &%[1st]%& and &%[2nd]%& are used to indicate it, with the
directive &%[all]%& marking the bar where all the endings are complete.
.code
b-f'-e'-; d'_c'- | [1st] g-d'-d'- g. :) |
[2nd] c'=b=c'-a- b. | [all] (: d'-c'-b- a_g- |
.endd

.music music15 50 0,-16 centre

The &%[all]%& directive is not used when the second time bar is the final bar
of a piece. Instructions such as &'Da capo'& are given as text strings, and the
music font contains the two conventional signs used in conjunction with &'Dal
segno'&. They correspond to the letters c and d, and can be included in text
strings as follows:

.itable none 0 0 2  60 left  200 left
.row &`"\mf\c"`&  "gives&~&~ &{{c}}&"
.row &`"\mf\d"`&  "gives&~&~ &{{d}}&"
.endtable

The escape sequence &`\mf\`& changes to the music font, full details of which
are given in chapter &<<CHAPfont>>&.



.section "Hairpins"
.index "hairpins"
Crescendo and diminuendo `hairpins' are coded using the characters &`<`&
and &`>`& in pairs. The hairpin starts at the note following &`<`& or
&`>`& and ends at the note before the next one. Hairpins are drawn below the
stave by default, but the directive &%[hairpins above]%& can be used to cause
them to be drawn above. Either end of a hairpin can be moved by following the
angle bracket with &`/u`& (up), &`/d`& (down), &`/l`& (left), or &`/r`&
(right), and a number, which gives a distance in points. Any up or down
movements specified at the start of a hairpin apply to the whole hairpin, but
any that are specified at the end apply only to the end &-- by this means,
sloping hairpins can be drawn.
.display
&`&~< abc'd' <  |  </d4 abc'd' </l10  |  </r4/d8 abc'd' </u10`&
.endd

.music music16 44 0,-6 centre

If the beginning or ending character is followed by &`/h`&, the
corresponding end of the hairpin is moved to the right to be halfway between
the note where it would otherwise be, and the next note, or the bar line if
there are no more notes in the bar. Additional left and right movements can be
specified, and are relative to this point. There are also some other options
for changing the position and form of hairpins (&R; &<<SECThairpins>>&).


.section "Staves and systems"
This section gives some introductory information about setting up staves and
systems. The reference chapters describe additional facilities for use in
complicated cases.


.subsection "Stave spacing"
.index "staves" "spacing"
.index "spacing" "staves"
.index "default" "stave spacing"
The default spacing between staves is 44 points. This is the distance between
the bottom line of one stave and the bottom line of the one below it. The
&%stavespacing%& header directive is used to alter this. In the most simple
case it is followed by a single dimension, which sets the same spacing for all
staves. This directive may also be followed (optionally after a single
dimension) by a list of stave numbers and spacings, each pair being
separated by a slash. These set spacings for specific staves; each dimesion is
a distances to the stave below.
.code
stavespacing 2/60 4/54
.endd
This example specifies that the spacing between staves 2 and 3 is to be 60
points, and that between 4 and 5 is to be 54 points. The remaining spacings
will take the default value of 44 points. PMW does not make any alterations to
stave spacings by itself. However, there is commonly a requirement to make a
change in the spacings for one particular system, usually when one stave has
unusually high or low notes. This can be done by using the &%[sshere]%&
directive. When this is encountered, it causes the spacing to be changed for
the current system only. A completely new value can be given, but if a number
is given preceded by a plus or minus sign, it causes a change in the spacing of
that amount.

.itable none 0 0 2  100 left  200 left
.row "&`[sshere +4]`&"   "increases the spacing by 4 points"
.row "&`[sshere -2]`&"   "decreases the spacing by 2 points"
.row "&`[sshere 48]`&"   "sets the spacing to 48 points"
.endtable

If there is more than one &%[sshere]%& in the same stave in a single system,
the last absolute setting (if any) is used, with any relative changes acting
cumulatively. For more details see sections &<<SUBSECTstavespacing>>& and
&<<SUBSECTss>>&, which also describe facilities for adjusting the amount of
space above a stave.


.subsection "System gap"
.index "system gap"
.index "spacing" "systems"
.index "gaps" "between systems"
The distance between systems is called the `system gap', and is set by the
&%systemgap%& header directive. Again, the default is 44 points. However,
since PMW normally puts additional space between systems so that the bottom
stave is at the bottom of the page, the system gap value is really a minimum
distance between systems. (See the &%justify%& directive if you want to stop
PMW from doing this vertical justification.) There is an &%[sghere]%& directive
for changing the system gap for a single system, and it works in exactly the
same way as &%[sshere]%&.  For more details see section &<<SUBSECTsg>>&.


.subsection "System separators"
It is common in scores to have two short thick lines between systems at the
lefthand side, to emphasise visually where a new system begins. PMW can be
configured to output such lines; see section &<<SUBSECTsystemseparator>>& for
details.


.subsection "Brackets and braces"
.index "joining signs"
.index "staves" "joining signs"
By default, PMW joins together the staves that comprise a system with a
bracket. The other kind of joining sign (used most often for two staves for one
instrument) is the brace, which is a large version of the &`{`& character.
.index "&%bracket%&"
.index "&%brace%&"
There are two header directives, &%bracket%& and &%brace%&, that specify
which staves are to be joined with each of these signs. Each of these
directives is followed by a list of stave ranges.
.code
bracket 1-4, 8-11
brace 5-6
.endd
This example causes the system to be divided into three sets of staves. Two of
the groups, staves 1&--4 and 8&--11, are each joined by a bracket, whereas
staves 5&--6 are joined by a brace. If you don't want any staves at all to be
bracketed, as might be the case when setting a keyboard piece, you need to
include the directive &%bracket%& with nothing after it, in order to cancel the
default setting, which is to bracket all the staves of the system.


.subsection "Initial text"
.index "text" "at stave start"
At the start of a piece it is common to show the names of the voices and/or
instruments to the left of the first system. This is done by giving a string in
quotes as part of the &%[stave]%& directive.
.code
[stave 1 "Clarinet" treble 1]
.endd
The text can be split up into several lines by including vertical bar
characters; each vertical bar causes a line break.
.code
[stave 5 "Horn|in F" treble 1]
.endd
Options are available for changing the form and layout of this text (&R;
&<<SUBSECTstavetext>>&).



.section "Keyboard staves"
.index "keyboard staves"
.index "staves" "keyboard"
Keyboard music is one of the more complicated kinds of music to typeset,
especially if it is a reduction of an instrumental score. It is usually a good
idea to study the manuscript carefully to decide exactly how it is to be
encoded before you start. A brace is normally used to join the staves of
keyboard music, with the name of the instrument mid-way between the two staves.
This can by done by adding &`/m`& to the relevant string (see the example in
the next section).


.subsection "Overprinted staves"
.index "overprinting" "staves"
.index "staves" "overprinted"
There are two ways of tackling pieces that have two parts on one stave, with
stems pointing in different directions. If most of the piece is like this, the
best approach is to use two different PMW staves, but specify a stave spacing
of zero for the first one so that the staves appear on top of each other. Use
can be made of the directives &%[stems up]%& and &%[stems down]%& to force the
stem directions of all notes. The directives &%[ties above]%& and &%[ties
below]%& can also be used to force the default direction of all ties. In the
following example, two PMW staves have been used for each visible stave, and
the stave spacings have been set accordingly. The spacing after stave 2 has
been increased to avoid clashes of stems between the two staves.
.code
time 3/4
bracket
brace 1-4
stavespacing 1/0 2/48 3/0

[stave 1 "Piano"/m treble 1 stems up ties above]
Ae' | d'_af | e_fe | D. |
[endstave]

[stave 2 treble 1 stems down ties below]
e_da | A#d | [smove 6] %<d_#cc | D. |
[endstave]

[stave 3 bass 0 stems up ties above]
Ac' | D'b | g_ag | F. |
[endstave]

[stave 4 bass 0 stems down ties below]
[smove 6] Gg | Fb` | $b`_a`a` | D. |
[endstave]
.endd

.music music17 74 0,-16

There are two items in this example that have not yet been explained; both are
connected with handling the case when a note on one stave would partially
obscure a note on the overprinting stave. PMW is not clever enough to detect
that two notes are going to interfere in this way, so the input must contain
explicit instructions to move one of the notes. Consider the very first pair of
notes on the bottom stave; they are A and G and so would collide at the same
horizontal position. To prevent this, the directive &%[smove 6]%& has been
used. This directive has two effects:
.ilist
It moves the following note (in this case, the G) 6 points to the right,
without affecting the position of anything else.
.next
It inserts an additional 6 points of space &'after'& the next note. That is,
everything after the next note is moved 6 points to the right.
.endlist
Each of these effects can be realized independently, by means of the &%[move]%&
and &%[space]%& directives; &%[smove]%& is a composite of the two, provided
because they are so frequently required together in this situation.

The second additional item can be seen in the third bar of stave 2. The D
natural has been moved to the right by means of &%[smove]%& but by itself this
would have caused its accidental to collide with the E that we are trying to
avoid. The &`<`& character after the percent sign (which is the code for a
natural) has the effect of moving the accidental 5 points to the left. This is
sufficient to get it clear.


.subsection "The [reset] and [backup] directives"
.index "&%[reset]%&"
.index "&%[backup]%&
.index "overprinting" "single bars"
If a stave can mostly be encoded using only a single PMW stave, but there are
one or two bars where stems in opposite directions are required, the
&%[reset]%& directive can be used. This has the effect of resetting to the
beginning of the bar, so that a second set of notes can be specified for the
bar. For example, the first bar of the right-hand part in the example above
could be encoded on a single PMW stave like this:
.code
[stems up] Ae' [reset] [stems down] e_/b da |
.endd
There is also a &%[backup]%& directive, which just backs up by one note.


.subsection "Invisible rests"
.index "invisible items" "rests"
.index "rests" "invisible"
When using overprinting staves for keyboard pieces, it is frequently the case
that one `part' does not contain enough notes to fill the bar. The note letter
Q can be used to make the bar up to its correct length. This letter (which can
be thought of as standing for `quiet') acts exactly like the rest letter R,
except that nothing is output. It is often referred to as an `invisible rest'.
See section &<<SUBSECTrests>>& for more details about special kinds of rest.


.subsection "Coupled staves" SUBSECTcoupleintro
.index "coupled staves"
.index "staves" "coupled"
.index "treble/bass coupling"
.index "bass/treble coupling"
Keyboard music sometimes includes sets of beamed notes that extend over both
staves. These can be handled using a technique known as `coupling':
.code
[stave 1 treble 1 couple down]
g-e-c-g`-e`-c`- | e'-\sd\c'-g-g`-\sw\e`-c`-
[endstave]

[stave 2 bass 0]
Q! | Q! |
[endstave]
.endd

.music music22 70 8,-16

The upper stave has been `coupled' downwards to the lower one. When this is
done, any note in the upper stave that is lower than middle C is put on the
lower stave. Notice the use of invisible rests on the lower stave to fill the
bars without showing anything. An alternative approach is to use &%[couple
up]%& to get notes from the lower stave that are higher than middle C put
on the upper stave. Simultaneous coupling of two staves in both directions is
permitted.

&*Warning:*& Coupling does not work properly unless the upper stave is using
the treble clef and the lower one is using the bass clef, and the distance
between them is a multiple of four points.

The second bar of this example shows how to position notes on both sides of
a beam, a facility that is often needed when using coupled staves. The
&`\sd\`& option on the first note of the beam forces its stem to be
downwards. Normally, this would mean that all the other notes in the beam would
also have downward pointing stems. However, the fourth note has the option
&`\sw\`&, which has the effect of swapping the stem direction for the
remaining notes.

For a stem direction swap to work, the two nearest notes have to be fairly far
apart, as these two are. If stem swapping is tried in the middle of the first
bar of this example, PMW generates an error, because there is not enough space
to fit the beam in between the two sets of notes. The coupling state can be
changed as often as necessary in a piece: &%[couple off]%& turns it off.



.section "Heads and feet"
.index "head lines"
.index "foot lines"
.index "&%heading%&"
We introduced the &%heading%& directive in chapter &<<CHAPfirstintro>>&. You
may have as many &%heading%& directives as you like at the start of a piece. By
default, the first two appear in larger type than the remainder. However,
you can specify an explicit font size by giving a number before the string:
.code
heading 13 "|Scherzo"
.endd
This example specifies a size of 13 points. After outputting a heading, the
`current point' is moved down the page by a distance equal to the font size, so
a second heading after the one above would be placed 13 points below it. You
can control this distance by giving a number after the string:
.code
heading 16 "|Mass" 24
.endd
This example specifies a type size of 16 points, and a subsequent space of 24
points. One special case of this is to specify a distance of zero so that the
next heading is at the same level. This makes it possible to have different
sizes on the same line.
.code
heading 16 "|Piece" 0
heading 12 "Words: J. Smith||Music: A. Jones" 24
.endd
In this example, the first heading consists of centred text, and the second has
only left-hand and right-hand parts, with nothing in the middle, so they do not
overlap.

.index "&%footing%&"
The &%footing%& directive is of exactly the same form as &%heading%&; it
specifies text for the bottom of the first page. The escape sequence &`\c)`& is
useful in footings; it becomes &copy;. Both &%heading%& and &%footing%& apply
to the first page of a piece only. To output heads and feet on other pages, you
must use the &%pageheading%& and &%pagefooting%& directives.
.index "&%pageheading%&"
.index "&%pagefooting%&"
The &%pageheading%& directive applies to all pages except the first, and
&%pagefooting%& applies to all pages, unless overridden for the first page by a
&%footing%& directive.
.index "page numbers"
.index "numbering pages"
The most common use of these directives is for outputting page numbers at the
top or bottom of each page. There are three escape sequences for inserting a
page number into a string:
.itable none 0 0 2  30 left  400 left
.row &`\p\`&   "the current page number"
.row &`\pe\`&  "the current page number only if it is even"
.row &`\po\`&  "the current page number only if it is odd"
.endtable
This is a typical example:
.code
pagefooting "|\p\"
.endd
It puts the page number centrally at the foot of each page (unless there is
also a &%footing%& directive for something different on the first page).
.code
pageheading "\pe\||\po\"
.endd
This example causes page numbers to appear at the top of each page other than
the first, alternately on the left and right. Even numbers are on the left, odd
ones on the right.

.index "heading" "printing outside margins"
.index "footing" "printing outside margins"
.index "margin" "printing outside"
When heading or footing text contains left-hand and right-hand parts, these
line up with the left and right edges of the music staves. Page numbers are
sometimes needed outside these normal margins. The easiest way to do this is to
make use of one of the special characters in the music font. These are
characters that cause no marks to be made on the page, but which move the
current position. They are provided for use by PMW when building up complicated
shapes from simpler ones, but they can be used for other purposes as well.

Full details of the music font are given in chapter &<<CHAPfont>>&. The
character of interest here is character number 123, which corresponds to the
&`{`& character in text fonts. It causes a leftwards movement of 0.33 times the
font's size (for example, 3.3 points for a 10-point font). Consider this
directive:
.code
pageheading "\mf\{{{{\rm\\pe\||\po\\mf\{{{{"
.endd
The escape sequence &`\mf\`& changes to the music font. The string of four
&`{`& characters causes a leftwards movement of the current position, so that
the even page number will appear to the left of the normal margin (&`\rm\`&
changes back to the roman font). At the end of the line, the backwards spacing
must follow the page number. At first sight it looks odd to end a string with
spacing characters, but because this is a right-aligned string that must end at
the right-hand margin, the backwards movement has the effect of causing the odd
page numbers to appear to the right of the normal margin, so that the
subsequent leftwards movement brings the current point back to the margin.

Another common requirement is to put page numbers higher up the page than PMW
normally starts. This can be achieved by using a &%pageheading%& directive with
an empty text string and a negative downwards movement.
.code
pageheading "" -10
.endd
This example has the effect of moving up the page by 10 points.



.section "Page layout"
.index "page layout"
.index "layout of pages"
The horizontal length of music systems can be set by means of the
&%linelength%& directive, and the vertical length of pages by the
&%pagelength%& directive. The default values are:
.code
linelength 480
pagelength 720
.endd
These are suitable values for A4 paper while leaving fairly generous margins,
especially at the sides. The linelength can be increased to as much as 520 for
A4 paper without getting too near the edges. The music is positioned centrally
on the page, so changing the line length changes both margins symmetrically.
PMW defaults to A4 paper, but the &%sheetsize%& directive can be used to set
A3, as well as some other standard sizes, and the &%sheetwidth%& and
&%sheetdepth%& directives can be used to set the dimensions of the paper
independently. The value given for the page length sets the space used for
headings and music systems. However, it does not include the space for
footings, which always start 20 points below the page length distance down the
page.

By default, PMW fills up each system with as many bars as it can within the
given line length, and then fills up each page with as many systems as it can.
Sometimes this means that the music takes up more or fewer pages than required,
or does not end tidily at the end of a page. If you know the layout that is
required in advance, you can use the &%layout%& header directive to specify
how many bars there are in each system and how many systems there are on each
page. Otherwise, when using the default filling mechanism, the following stave
directives can be used to influence the layout:

.ilist
The &%[newline]%& directive causes PMW to start a new line of music (a new
system) with the bar in which it appears. It need appear only in one stave.
.next
The &%[newpage]%& directive causes PMW to start a new page with the system in
which it appears. It need appear only in one stave.
.next
The &%notespacing%& directive can be used to spread out or to compress the
music. This example reduces all the distances by a factor of 0.92:
.code
notespacing *0.92

However much you reduce the notespacing, PMW will not allow notes to be output
on top of each other. Quite small changes of note spacing can sometimes make
dramatic changes to the layout of a piece, by causing changes in the assignment
of bars to systems. At other times, for example when bars are very long, a
large change might be needed to have any effect.

Occasionally it is helpful to change the notespacing for part of a piece only.
This can be done by using the &%[notespacing]%& stave directive (abbreviation
&%[ns]%&). This should always be given at the start of a bar; it then affects
the current bar and subsequent ones. If it is given without a value, the
spacing is reset to what it was at the start of the piece. Therefore, to reduce
the spacing for one bar only, one might have:
.code
[ns *0.8] g=a=b=g=; b=a=g=b= | [ns] D |
.endd
This should be given in the first stave because PMW processes the staves in
order, for each bar, and any previous staves would be processed using the old
value. That is also why resetting the value should be done in the next bar; if
&%[ns]%& were at the end of the first bar, the reset values would be used for
the following staves. Another way of fitting a piece onto a given number of
pages is to change the magnification, as described in the next section.


.section "Magnification" SECTmagnification
.index "magnification"
The standard size of music formatted by PMW has a distance of 4 points between
stave lines. The &%magnification%& header directive can be used to cause it to
output bigger or smaller staves.
.code
magnification 1.5
magnification 0.75
.endd
The first example has the effect of increasing the gap between stave lines to 6
points, whereas the second reduces it to 3 points. There is also a directive
called &%stavesize%& (&R; &<<SUBSECTstavesize>>&) that can be used to alter the
magnification for individual staves, relative to the overall magnification.
There are no restrictions on the values that can be given for the
magnification.

When a magnification is specified, everything is magnified (or reduced) in
proportion, and the distances given in PMW directives are all magnified too.
This means that if a vertical distance is specified as 4 points, it is always
equal to the distance between stave lines. Thus, changing the magnification
does not require changes to the music data. However, exceptionally, the values
given for the &%linelength%& and &%pagelength%& directives are &'not'&
magnified or reduced. They specify the real dimensions of the page, and so do
not have to be changed if the magnification is altered.


.section "Extracting parts from a score"
.index "extracting parts from a score"
.index "parts, extracting from score"
When a score file has been created, individual parts can be extracted by using
the &%-s%& command line option, as described in section &<<CHAPrunningpmw>>&.
For example, if the input were a string quartet, selecting stave 2 would cause
just the second violin part to be output. Usually, you will want to make some
changes for a part. At the very least, the headings will probably be different,
and you may want to have cue notes in parts but not in the score. You may also
want to output parts at a larger magnification, and force page or line breaks at
particular places. This is where PMW's &'conditional directives'& come in.
These are preprocessing directives that allow you to skip parts of the input
file under certain conditions. For example, the start of a file might be
something like this:
.code
*if score
  magnification 0.9
*else
  magnification 1.3
*fi
.endd
.index "&%*if%&"
.index "&%*else%&"
.index "&%*fi%&"
Because they are preprocessing directives, each &%*if%&, &%*else%&, or &%*fi%&
must appear on a line by itself. In the example above, &%*if%& tests to see
whether a full score is being output, and if so, sets the magnification to
0.9. Otherwise it sets it to 1.3. PMW considers that a score is being output
if no staves are selected by the &%-s%& command line option. The &%*if%&
directive can also test for individual stave selections, and this is the way to
set up appropriate headings:
.code
*if stave 1
  heading "Violin I"
*fi
*if stave 2
  heading "Violin II"
*fi
*if stave 3
  heading "Viola"
*fi
*if stave 4
  heading "Violoncello"
*fi
.endd
The `stave' test succeeds if the given stave, and only the given stave, is
selected, but it is possible to give a list or range of staves (and to use the
plural `staves'):
.code
*if staves 1-2
  heading "Violins"
*fi
.endd
.index "format option"
Finally, the &%*if%& directive can be used to test for an arbitrary &'format
name'& defined by the user. You specify the format using the &%-f%& option in
the PMW command line. It can be any word that you like. For example, if you
wanted to extract the string parts from a score, instead of explicitly
specifying the stave numbers each time, you could specify `strings' as the
format, and use input such as:
.code
*if strings
  selectstaves 4-9
*fi
.endd
The &%selectstaves%& directive has the same effect as selecting staves by the
&%-s%& command line option (which it overrides), provided it precedes any tests
on the stave selection. This facility can be put to many other uses for varying
the format of the output.

It is not necessary to indent the directives that appear between &%*if%& and
&%*fi%&, but it helps make the input more readable. These conditional
preprocessing directives can be used anywhere in a PMW file, not just in the
header portion. Here is an example that shows how to notate rest bars in a
score, but cue bars in a part:
.code
[stave 6 "Trumpet" treble 1]
[20] R! |
*if score
  [2] R! |
*else
  "(flute)"/a [cue] g'f'e' | [cue] C'. |
*fi
.endd
The &%[cue]%& directive specifies that the remaining notes in the bar are to
be output at the cue note size.

.chapter "Standard Macros" CHAPstdmacs
.index "standard macros"
.index "macros" "standard"
The use of macros is introduced above. Several files of pre-defined macros are
provided with PMW. They contain shorthands for a number of common requirements.
Suggestions for additions are welcome.

.ilist
&%FBass%& contains macros for figured bass notation.
.next
&%Fingering%& contains macros for fingering numbers.
.next
&%StdMacs%& contains macros for a number of common items, including dynamics.
.endlist

The &%*include%& preprocessing directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTinclude>>&) gives
access to these files, for example:
.code
*include "Fingering"
.endd
However, you must not have a file of your own called &%Fingering%& because that
will take precedence.


.section "Figured bass macros"
.index "figured bass" "macros"
The standard macro file called &%FigBass%& contains a general macro for figured
bass numbers, along with some shorthands for common figurings. You can change
two aspects of these macros by defining either or both of the macros &`FBI`& or
&`FBU`& before including the &%FigBass%& file. &`FBI`& specifies initial text
for the start of each figured bass string. It defaults to &`\mf\z`& which uses
the music font to insert a small amount of white space &-- this makes for
better alignment with the notes. &`FBU`& specifies the type of text to use. It
defaults to &`/fbu`&, which specifies text at the figured bass size (see the
&%fbsize%& directive), positioned at the underlay level. This ensures that the
top line of figured bass numbers are all at the same level. You can change this
to &`/fb`&:
.code
*define FBU /fb
*include "FigBass"
.endd
In this configuration, each figuring's vertical position depends on the note
above. The basic figured bass macro is called &`FB`&, and it takes up to three
arguments, which are output one below the other. It is placed immediately
before the note to which it applies, as in these examples:
.code
&FB(3) g  &FB(3,4) g  &FB(7,2,4) G
.endd
There are three macros for isolated accidentals, called &`FBF`& (flat), &`FBN`&
(natural) and &`FBS`& (sharp). There are also a number of shorthands for common
figurings. All of them are shown below:

.music music68 200,-50

The names of the macros are intended to suggest their contents, with `b' for
`below', `c` for `cross', `f' for `flat', `n' for `natural', `s' for `sharp',
and `u' for `underscore'. There are two versions of some crossed numbers, the
plain `c' versions using a character in the music font, whereas the `cp'
versions use a normal digit overprinted with a `+', which makes the cross more
prominent.


.section "Fingering macros" SECTfingeringmacros
.index "fingering indications" "macros"
The standard macro file called &%Fingering%& contains definitions of macros
whose names are &`&&0`&, &`&&1`&, &`&&2`&, &`&&3`&, &`&&4`&, and &`&&5`&, plus
one called &`&&THUMB`& for the cello thumb sign &{&#97;}&&nbsp;&nbsp;. Like the
figured bass macros, these must appear before the note to which they refer.
There is an issue if you want to use both the figured bass and the fingering
macros at the same time, because there is a name clash. For this reason, a
prefix can be set for the fingering macros. If your input is like this:
.code
*define FINGERPREFIX f
*include "Fingering"
.endd
the names of the fingering macros become &`&&f0`&, &`&&f1`&, etc. You can also
change the size of the numbers by setting &`FINGERSIZE`& for the numbers and
&`THUMBSIZE`& for the thumb indicator. Finally, you can set &`FINGERTYPE`& to
adjust the position. The default is &`/a/c`&, which puts the fingering above
the note, centred. An individual number can be forced below the note by
following the macro call with &`/b`&, but if you want them all below, setting
&`FINGERTYPE`& may be more convenient. There is more discussion of fingering
and an example below (&R; &<<SECTfingeringindics>>&).


.section "Miscellaneous macros"
The standard macro file &%StdMacs%& contains definitions for a number of common
musical notations.

.subsection "Dynamics and common instructions"
The meaning of the following macro names should be obvious:

&`f ff fff fp fz mf mp p pp ppp sf sfz fsubito fsub psubito psub ppsubito ppsub
animato cantabile atempo cresc decresc semprecresc dim pocorall pocorit
ponticallo naturale legno rall rit simile sonore sotto tempo1 ten tranq`&


.subsection "Slur shorthands"
The macros &`sa`& and &`sb`& are shorthands for starting a slur above or below
the notes respectively. Additional options for the slur may be given as an
argument to the macro call. For example, to move the start of a slur up and to
the right one might have &`&&sa(/u4/r2)`&. There is also a macro called &`es`&
to end a slur, where again options may be given as an argument.


.subsection "Octavo marks"
The macros &`S8a`& and &`S8b`& notate the start of an `8va' marking above or
below the stave, respectively, with &`E8a`& and &`E8b`& marking the end. There
a discussion of how these work below (&R; &<<SUBSECTuolayother>>&).


.subsection "Piano pedal marks"
.index "piano pedal marks"
The macro &`ped`& puts a conventional &{&#163;}& sign below the stave, and
&`pedstar`& outputs &{$}&. There also three macros for pedal markings with
horizontal lines: &`&&pedline`& follows &{&#163;}& with a horizontal line that
continues till &`&&pedend`& is reached. Intermediate `blips' can be created
with &`&&pedblip`&. Here is a simple example:

.code
&ped C e &pedstar g | &pedline Cdg | &pedblip geC &pedend |
.endd

.music music69 40 0,-10

An optional argument for &`&&pedline`& is a downward movement (default 6) and
an optional argument for &`&&pedblip`& is the width of the blip (default 4).
There is discussion of how these macros work in the description of the
&%[linegap]%& directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTlinegap>>&).

.chapter "PMW reference description" CHAPreference
Earlier chapters describe the basic features of the PMW music encoding in an
introductory manner, in an order suitable for this purpose. Using only the
material therein, you should be able to typeset a wide variety of music.
However, there are many special-purpose features that have not yet been
covered. The remainder of this document is written in the form of a reference
manual. It contains a complete description of PMW input files, repeating in
more detail some of what has gone before. PMW has many in-built features for
common music notation. More unusual requirements can be met by making use of
PMWs drawing features, described in chapter &<<CHAPdraw>>&. Some examples can
be found in the &_contrib_& directory in the PMW distribution.

.index "reference syntax"
.index "syntax for reference section"
When describing the syntax of directives, use is often made of one or more
italic words in angle brackets, for example:
.display
&`tupletfont`& <&'fontsize'&> <&'name'&>
.endd
What this means is that the bracketed italic words must be replaced by some
specific instance of what they describe (in this case, values for the font size
and the font name) when the directive is used. This is an example of the use
of &%tupletfont%&:
.code
tupletfont 8 italic
.endd
Frequently, when the required value is a single number, &'n'& or some other
single letter is used. In the example above, <&'fontsize'&> was replaced by a
single number; however, more complicated ways of specifying the size of a font
are possible (&R; &<<SECTfontsize>>&).

The following sections describe the format of PMW input files, and then discuss
a number of general features, with references to particular directives.
Complete descriptions of the directives themselves are not given here; they may
be found in &'Header directives'& and &'Stave directives'& (chapters
&<<CHAPheaddir>>& and &<<CHAPstavedirectives>>&). The chapter in between,
&'Stave data'& (chapter &<<CHAPstavedata>>&), contains the specification of all
items other than directives that may appear as part of a stave's data.



.section "Format of PMW files" SECTfileformat
.index "input file format"
.index "file format"
.index "format of input file"
A file containing input for PMW is a text file in 8-bit UTF-8 Unicode format.
However, non-ASCII characters (those with code points greater than 127) are
recognized only within text strings. All other notation uses only ASCII
characters. You can use any available text editor or wordprocessor to create
such files. The input is in free format. Outside quoted strings, there is only
one circumstance in which the use of white space is necessary, and that is
.index "space character"
to delimit an item when there would otherwise be ambiguity, for example, when a
word is followed by another word. However, spaces are allowed between items,
and can be profitably used to increase the readability of the file. Other than
in quoted strings, a sequence of spaces is equivalent to one space.

.index "@ (comment) character"
.index "comment character"
.index "annotating input"
The character &`@`& is a comment character; if it appears outside a quoted
string, the rest of the input line is ignored. This provides a way of
annotating PMW input files. The first line of a file is very often something
like this:
.code
@ Created by Christopher Columbus, October 1492
.endd



.subsection "Line breaks"
.index "line breaks"
Line breaks in a PMW input file are equivalent to spaces, except in these
circumstances:
.ilist
When a line contains a comment (see above), all characters from the
introductory &`@`& character to the end of the line are ignored.
.next
Line breaks are not permitted within the options that follow a note between two
backslash characters, whereas other white space is allowed.
.next
When a directive name is followed by a list of stave numbers, these can be
separated by commas and/or white space, but must all be on one line.
.next
Line breaks are not permitted within the arguments of a macro call (&R;
&<<SECTdefine>>&), nor within the argument of a string repetition (&R;
&<<SUBSECTstringrepetition>>&).
.next
Preprocessing directives (&R; &<<SECTpreprocess>>&) always take up a complete
line of their own, and may not continue onto subsequent lines.
.endlist
Line breaks inside quoted strings are converted to spaces.


.subsection "Ignoring line breaks" SUBSECTconcatenation
.index "line breaks" "ignoring"
.index "concatenating input lines"
.index "lines" "concatenating input"
.index "&A3; (line concatenator)"
The restrictions on line breaks just described may occasionally cause a very
long line to be required. For example, a macro that generates a number of bars
may have quite a long replacement string. To aid readability in such cases, a
feature is provided for joining two or more input lines into one long line. If
an input line ends with three ampersands (&`&A3;`&), the ampersands and the
newline are removed, and the next line is concatenated. This happens before any
other processing. For example,
.display
&`*define &A3;`&
&`cresc &A3;`&
&`"Crescendo"/b`&
.endd
is converted into the single line
.code
*define cresc "Crescendo"/b
.endd
before being processed.


.subsection "Macro insertion and repetition"
.index "&& (insert) character"
.index "insert character"
.index "macros" "insertion"
In addition to its use in line concatenation, the character &`&&`& is an insert
character that is recognized at any point in the file. It must be followed
either by an asterisk and a number, or by the name of a previously-defined
macro. The former syntax is used for repeating a sequence of characters (&R;
&<<SUBSECTstringrepetition>>&). If a macro name follows, the macro's contents
are inserted at that point &-- for details, see the description of the
&%*define%& preprocessing directive in section &<<SECTdefine>>&. If a literal
&`&&`& character is actually required in the input, it must be entered as
&`&&&&`&.


.subsection "Case sensitivity"
.index "case-sensitivity"
PMW is case-sensitive. That is, it distinguishes between capital (upper case)
and small (lower case) letters. The only places where case does not matter are:
.ilist
In the names of directives (&`KEY`& is equivalent to &`key`&);
.next
In the names of key signatures (&`E$M`& is equivalent to &`e$m`&);
.next
In the `common' and `cut' (alla breve) time signatures (&`C`& and &`A`& are
equivalent to &`c`& and &`a`&);
.next
In format words used to specify alternative forms of output;
.next
In words following the &%*if%& preprocessing directive.
.endlist


.subsection "Header information"
.index "file header"
.index "header" "for PMW file"
A PMW file starts with a number of directives collectively known as the
&'header'&. These provide information that applies to the whole piece of music,
for example, one or more title lines, and they may also change the values of
parameters such as the line length that control the final layout on the page.
If the file contains multiple movements (&R; &<<SUBSECTmovement>>&) there can
be a set of header directives for each movement, though some parameters (for
example, the magnification) can be set only at the start.

.index "title pages"
If the title lines fill up a lot of the page, there may be insufficient
room for the first system of music, which is therefore moved onto the next
page. This gives a way of producing a title page followed by pages of music,
all from a single input file. The header is terminated by the first unquoted
opening square bracket in the file, and may be completely empty.



.subsection "Stave information"
Following the header there is information for each stave, in this form:
.index "&%[stave]%&"
.display
&`[stave `&<&'n'&> <&'additional data'&>&`]`&
<&'notes and other stave items'&>
&`[endstave]`&
.endd
A description of the &%[stave]%& directive is given in section
&<<SUBSECTstave>>&.
.index "maximum number of staves"
There may be up to 63 normal staves, numbered from 1 to 63. They can be defined
in any order, though they are always output in numerical order down the page.
Data may also be supplied for a stave numbered 0, which has special properties
(&R; &<<SECTstave0>>&). If a stave numbered &'n'& is present, all the staves
with numbers lower than &'n'&
.index "missing staves"
.index "staves" "missing"
are automatically supplied as empty staves if they do not appear in the input.
For example, if only staves 2 and 4 are given, empty staves 1 and 3 are
manufactured.

.index "concert posters"
.index "posters"
A PMW input file need not contain any stave data at all; in this circumstance
the only output will be the headings and footings, on a single page. This is a
slightly eccentric way of creating concert posters.



.subsection "Multiple movements" SUBSECTmovement
.index "movement" "specifying"
.index "&%[newmovement]%&"
A PMW file may contain more than one movement, that is, the piece may be split
up into several independent sections, each with its own title. It is worth
doing this if there is some possibility of not having to start a new page for
each movement. If you know that each movement will always start on a new page,
you might prefer to keep each movement in a separate file. (See the
&%*include%& preprocessing directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTinclude>>&) for a way of
including a common header when processing each file.)
The term `movement' is something of a misnomer. All it means to PMW is that
another piece of music is to follow, possibly on the same page as the previous
one. A `movement' may be as short as a few bars of a musical example.
.index "&%[newmovement]%&"
The start of a new movement is indicated by the &%[newmovement]%& directive,
which must appear within a header or following the information for a stave.
After this there may appear a new set of header directives, followed by the
staves for the new movement. The general format of a complete PMW input file is
therefore as follows:
.display
&'Header information'&
&'First stave of first movement'&
&'Second stave of first movement'&
&mldr;
&'Last stave of first movement'&
&`[newmovement]`&
&'Supplementary header information'&
&'First stave of second movement'&
&'Second stave of second movement'&
&mldr;
etc.
.endd
.index "new page for movement"
.index "movement" "new page"
PMW starts a new page at the beginning of a new movement, unless there is
enough room on the current page for the headings and the first system, or, if
the first system contains only one stave, two systems. This can be overridden
by options on the &%[newmovement]%& directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTnewmovement>>&).
.index "movement" "non-persistent parameters"
In general, most parameters that can be set by header directives persist from
movement to movement, but &%doublenotes%&, &%halvenotes%&, &%key%&, &%layout%&,
&%notime%&, &%startbracketbar%&, &%startnotime%&, &%suspend%&, &%time%&,
&%transpose%&, and &%unfinished%& apply only to the movement for which they are
specified. &%Notespacing%& persists in one of its forms, but not the other.
.index "&%notespacing%&"
.code
notespacing 33 30 24 18 14 12 10 10
.endd
In this example, &%notespacing%& sets absolute note spacings at the start of a
movement. Such spacings are reset as the defaults at the start of subsequent
movements.
.code
notespacing *1.2
.endd
In this example, &%notespacing%& is used to multiply the current note spacings
by the given factor. Such a change does not persist into the next movement. Of
the parameters whose values persist, most may be changed by header directives
at the start of the new movement.
.index "movement" "first "
.index "directives" "first movement only"
However, the following directives may appear at the start of the first movement
only: &%b2pffont%&, &%drawbarlines%&, &%drawstavelines%&, &%eps%&,
&%incPMWfont%&, &%landscape%&, &%magnification%&, &%maxvertjustify%&,
&%midifornotesoff%&, &%musicfont%&, &%nokerning%&, &%nowidechars%&, &%output%&,
&%page%&, &%pagelength%&, &%righttoleft%&, &%sheetdepth%&, &%sheetsize%&,
&%sheetwidth%&, and &%textfont%&.


.section "Input preprocessing" SECTpreprocess
.index "directives" "preprocessing"
.index "preprocessing directives"
Each logical input line (possibly after concatenation of multiple physical
lines using the &`&&&&&&`& facility) is &'preprocessed'& before being
interpreted. Preprocessing allows the input to be modified in various ways, and
is controlled by special preprocessing directives. These may occur at any point
in an input file; in the header, in the middle of a stave's data, or between
staves. A preprocessing directive must be at the start of a line, preceded by
an asterisk (spaces before the asterisk are permitted). It takes up the rest of
the line; it may not continue onto the next line. Very long preprocessing
directives can be input on multiple physical lines by making use of the input
concatenation feature (&R; &<<SUBSECTconcatenation>>&).


.subsection "*Comment"
.index "&%*comment%&"
This directive causes the remainder of the input line to be written to the PMW
verification output (the standard error stream). It may be  useful for
outputting reminders to the user.


.subsection "*Define" SECTdefine
.index "macros" "definition"
.index "macros" "name length"
.index "strings" "macro-defined"
.index "&%*define%&"
The &%*define%& directive is used to define &'macros'&. A macro is a name for a
string of characters, usually for something that is needed more than once.
Using a macro ensures consistency, and a short name saves typing. The format of
&%*define%& for a simple macro is:
.display
&`*define`& <&'name'&> <&'rest of line'&>
.endd
The rest of the input line, starting from the first non-space after the name,
up to but not including the newline, is remembered and associated with
&'name'&, which must consist of a sequence of letters and digits and be no
longer than 256 characters. It may start with a letter or a digit, so names
such as &`8va`& can be used,
.index "macros" "form of names"
and upper and lower case letters are considered different in macro names. The
rest of the line may consist of no characters at all, in which case &'name'& is
associated with an empty string.

.index "comment on &%*define%&"
If there is a comment character @ on the input line, outside double quote
marks, it terminates the string that is being defined. That is, a comment is
permitted on a &%*define%& directive, provided there are either no quotes, or
only matched pairs of quotes, before the start of the comment. If you use
macros to generate partial strings, with unmatched quotes in the defining
lines, the use of the @ character should be avoided.

.subsection "Macro calls"
.index "&& (insert) character"
When an input line is preprocessed, the character &`&&`& is used as a flag
character to trigger the substitution of text wherever it appears (except when
it follows the @ comment character). There are three cases:
.ilist
The sequence &`&&`&&'name'& in the input is replaced by the remembered text of
the macro called &'name'&, which must have been previously defined.
.next
The sequence &`&&*`& followed by a number and a parenthesized argument is an
input sequence repetition, details of which are given below (&R;
&<<SUBSECTstringrepetition>>&).
.next
If a real ampersand character is required in the input, it must be entered as
&`&&&&`&.
.endlist
Any other character following &`&&`& causes an error message to be output. The
ampersand is then ignored.

.index "semicolon" "after macro name"
.index "; (semicolon)" "after macro name"
To avoid ambiguity, a semicolon character can optionally be used to terminate
the name in a simple macro substitution, for example, if the immediately
following character is a letter or a digit. The semicolon is removed from the
text when the substitution takes place. If an actual semicolon is required in
the input following such a substitution, two semicolons must be entered. If an
undefined name is encountered following &`&&`&, PMW issues an error message,
and substitutes an empty string. It is possible to test whether or not a name
has been defined (&R; &<<SUBSECTconditional>>&). An example of the use of a
simple macro is given in section &<<SECTmacro>>&.


.subsection "Macros with arguments" SUBSECTmacarg
.index "macros" "arguments"
.index "arguments for macros"
There are times when it is useful to be able to vary the text that is inserted
by a macro. The word &'argument'& is used in mathematics and computer
programming to describe values that are passed to functions and macros on each
call, and that term is adopted here. The argument values for a macro call are
passed in a pair of parentheses that immediately follow the macro name without
intervening white space. A semicolon that follows the closing parenthesis is
not treated specially and is interpreted as the next input item.

The use of arguments is best explained by an example. Suppose a piece of music
has many `hanging ties', that is, ties that extend to the right of a note but
end in mid-air rather than on the next note. The input to achieve this for the
note &`g'`& could be:
.code
[slur/rr15] g' [es]
.endd
To shorten this input, a macro with an argument can be defined as follows:
.code
*define hang()  [slur/rr15] &&1 [es]
.endd
The parentheses after the macro name tell PMW that this macro has one or more
arguments, and the characters &`&&&&1`& in the replacement text indicate the
place where the first argument is to be inserted. This macro can be used for
many different notes, for example:
.code
&hang(g') &hang(B++) &hang(e'-)
.endd
In each case, the text that forms the argument is substituted into the
replacement text where &`&&&&1`& appears. The argument is supplied
immediately after the macro name, enclosed in parentheses.

&*Note*&: When a macro is defined without parentheses, as in the previous
section, an opening parenthesis following the name in a macro call is not
treated as introducing arguments.

.index "macros" "maximum number of arguments"
Up to 20 arguments may be used. The example macro above could be extended
to make use of a second argument as follows:
.code
*define hang()  [slur/rr15&&2] &&1 [es]
.endd
Now it is possible to use a second argument to specify that the tie is to be
below the note, for example:
.code
&hang(g,/b)
.endd
.index "comma" "in macro argument"
.index ", (comma)" "in macro argument"
As this example shows, arguments are separated from each other by commas. All
the characters between the parentheses and commas form part of the argument;
if, for example, there is a space after the opening parenthesis or after a
comma, it forms part of the next argument. Arguments may contain no characters;
this is not an error. An argument can be inserted many times in the replacement
text.
.index "semicolon" "in macro argument"
.index "; (semicolon)" "in macro argument"
If the following character is a digit, the argument number must be
followed by a semicolon as a terminator. This means that if the following
character is a semicolon, two semicolons are required. There are also times
when it is necessary to include commas and parentheses as part of an argument.
The following rules make this possible:
.ilist
No special action is necessary if an argument contains matched parentheses.
Within them, commas are not recognized as terminating an argument, and an
internal closing parenthesis does not terminate the macro call. For example:
.code
&hang((fac'))
.endd
.next
To include an unmatched opening or closing parenthesis or a comma that is not
within nested parentheses, the character &`&&`& is used as an escape character.
For example, if a note with a bracketted (parenthesized) accidental is used
with the &`hang`& macro, the input is:
.code
&hang(#&)c')
.endd
Without the &`&&`& preceding it, the accidental's closing parenthesis would be
interpreted as terminating the argument list.
.next
If an argument contains matched double quote characters, commas and parentheses
(matched or unmatched) within the quotes are not treated specially. An
unmatched double quote character can be included by escaping it with &`&&`&.
.endlist
In fact, the appearance of &`&&`& before a non-alphanumeric character anywhere
in a macro argument always causes the next character to be taken literally,
whatever it is. To include an &`&&`& character itself within the text of an
argument, it must be specified as &`&&&&`&. Macro arguments may contain
references to other macros, to any arbitrary depth. An &`&&`& followed by an
alphanumeric character in an argument is interpreted as a nested macro
reference. It is also possible to have macro substitutions in the definition of
another macro.

.index "macros" "argument defaults"
If a macro that is defined with argument substitutions is called without
arguments, or with an insufficient number, nothing is substituted for those
that are not supplied, unless defaults have been provided as an argument list
in the macro definition. Each default argument must be no longer than 256
characters (arguments in macro calls can be longer). If a macro is defined or
called with more arguments than are referenced in its replacement string, the
additional arguments, either explicit or defaulted, are ignored. Here is an
example of the use of default arguments:
.code
*define hang(g',/a)  [slur/rr15&&2] &&1 [es]
.endd
When the macro is called, empty and missing arguments are replaced by the
defaults.
.itable none 0 0 3  80 left  60 left  200 left
.row &`&&hang()`&      "behaves as"   &`&&hang(g',/a)`&
.row &`&&hang`&        "behaves as"   &`&&hang(g',/a)`&
.row &`&&hang(B)`&     "behaves as"   &`&&hang(B,/a)`&
.row &`&&hang(,/b)`&   "behaves as"   &`&&hang(g',/b)`&
.endtable
The rules for the default argument list are the same as for argument lists when
calling macros, except that, if &`&&`& is required to escape a character, it
must be written twice. This is necessary because macro definition lines are
themselves subject to scanning for macro substitution before they are
interpreted. For example:
.code
*define hang(#&&)g') [slur/rr15] &&1 [es]
.endd
It follows that, if an &`&&`& character is actually required in a default
argument, &`&&&&&&&&`& must be entered.



.subsection "Input repetition" SUBSECTstringrepetition
.index "input repetition"
.index "repetition" "of input string"
A single bar may be repeated by starting it with a number in square brackets
(&R; &<<SECTrepeatbars>>&) and there is an input shortcut facility for
repeating individual notes (&R; &<<SUBSECTshortcuts>>&). There is also a way of
repeating an arbitrary string of input characters during preprocessing. This is
coded as an ampersand followed by an asterisk, a number, and then a single
argument in parentheses, in the same format as a macro argument. This example
generates the same sequence of bars three times in succession:
.code
&*3(abc|def|[2]R!|)
.endd
This example repeats a group of semiquavers four times, breaking the beam after
each group:
.code
&*4(g=a=b=c'=;)
.endd
An error occurs if more than one argument is given. This construction may be
nested and may contain ordinary macro calls. Like a macro call, the entire
argument must be on a single logical input line; if it is very long, line
concatenation (&R; &<<SUBSECTconcatenation>>&) can be used to spread it over
multiple lines in the input file.


.subsection "*Include" SUBSECTinclude
.index "&%*include%&"
.index "included files"
.index "files, including"
This directive can be used to include one file within another. For example, the
same standard header file could be used with a number of different pieces or
movements that require the same style. The name of the included file is given
in quotes:
.code
*include "std-setup"
.endd
If the name does not start with a slash, it is interpreted relative to the
directory containing the current input file, unless the current input is the
standard input, in which case a non-absolute path name is taken relative to the
current directory. If a file whose name contains no slashes cannot be found, it
is sought in the `standard macros' directory (&R; &<<CHAPstdmacs>>&). Included
files may be nested. That is, an included file may contain further &%*include%&
directives.



.subsection "Conditional preprocessing directives" SUBSECTconditional
.index "conditional directives"
.index "directives" "conditional"
.index "&%*if%&"
.index "&%*fi%&"
.index "&%*else%&"
The conditional preprocessing directives are &%*if%&, &%*else%&, and &%*fi%&.
Their purpose is to arrange for certain sections of the input file to be
included or omitted under certain circumstances. The &%*if%& directive is
followed by a condition, which consists of a word, possibly followed by more
data. It the condition is true, subsequent lines of the input, up to &%*else%&
or &%*fi%&, are processed. If the condition is not true, these lines are
skipped. When &%*else%& is used to terminate the block of lines after &%*if%&,
the lines between it and a subsequent &%*fi%& are obeyed or skipped depending
on whether the first block of lines was skipped or obeyed. An example will make
this clearer:
.code
*if score
  magnification 0.9
*else
  magnification 1.2
*fi
.endd
Each &%*if%& must have a matching &%*fi%&, but there need not be an &%*else%&
between them. It is permitted to nest conditional directives, that is, a
complete sequence of &%*if%& &rarr; &%*fi%& may occur within another. This
provides a way of testing that a number of conditions are all true. The word
`or' can be used in a condition to test whether either one of two (or more)
conditions is true:
.code
*if staves 1-3 or stave 7
*if violin or viola
.endd
If a condition is preceded by the word `not', the sense of the condition is
negated:
.code
*if not score
  magnification 1.2
*fi
.endd

We now describe the various conditions that can be tested using &%*if%&.

.ilist
If the word that follows &%*if%& or &%*if not%& is `score', the condition
is true only if no stave selection option is specified on the PMW command
line, and the &%selectstave%& directive has not been used earlier in the file.
.next
If the word is `part', the condition is true if and only if a stave selection
option is given on the command line, or via the &%selectstave%& directive
earlier in the file.
.next
If the word is `stave' or `staff' or `staves', it must be followed by a list
of staves. In this case, the condition is true if the listed staves, &'and no
others'&, are selected. The intended use is for varying the headings of the
piece when different combinations of staves are selected.
.next
If the word is `undef', it must be followed by a name, and the condition is
true only if the given name has not yet been defined as a macro using the
&%*define%& directive.
.next
If the word is `transpose' and no number follows, the condition is true if any
transposition, including zero transposition, is in force. If a positive or
negative number follows `transpose', the condition is true if that particular
transposition is in force.
.next
If the word  is `format', the condition is true if the &%-f%& command line
option has been used to specify a named format, and false otherwise.
.next
If the word is `PDF', the condition is true if PMW output is set to be a PDF.
Otherwise (for PostScript output) it is false. This condition is mainly for
testing so that the same input can be used for both kinds of output.
.next
.index "format option"
If the word following &%*if%& is not one of the above, the condition is false,
unless the &%-f%& command line option was used to specify the same word that
follows &%*if%& or &%*if not%& as a format name. The comparison of the words is
done in a case-independent manner.
.endlist

Here are some examples of the use of the conditional preprocessing directives:
.code flow
*if score              @ full score reduced
  magnification 0.8
*else                  @ part(s) magnified
  magnification 1.1
  systemgap 60
*fi

*if stave  1
  heading "Flute"
*fi
*if staves 2-3
  heading "Violins"
*fi

*if undef topspace
  *define topspace 20
*fi

*if transpose
  heading "|(Transposed version)"
*fi

*if large
  magnification 1.5
*fi
.endd
The last example would be triggered by including &*-f large*& on the PMW
command line. Only one format word can be set at a time in this way. It must
begin with a letter and consist of letters and digits only.



.section "Identification and counting of bars" SECTident
.index "bars" "identification of"
.index "identification of bars"
.index "numbering bars"
PMW identifies bars in its messages using the same number as would be output
as a bar number on the music. This applies both to error messages and to the
bar numbers that are used to verify the layout of systems on the page. This
makes it easy to associate messages with the actual bars of the music, but it
requires some special notation for identifying bars containing the
&%[nocount]%& directive.

If the first bar of a stave contains a &%[nocount]%& directive (which is the
most common use of &%[nocount]%&) it is identified as bar number zero, provided
that the &%bar%& directive has not been used. If there is more than one such
bar at the start of a stave, they are identified as `0', `0.1', `0.2', etc.
Bars other than at the start of a stave that contain &%[nocount]%& directives
are identified by the number of the previous counted bar, followed by `.1',
`.2', etc. as needed. This also applies to uncounted bars at the start of a
stave if &%[bar]%& has been used to set an initial bar number other than one.
For example, the following input contains five bars that would be identified in
messages as `0', `1', `2', `2.1', and `3':
.code
[stave 1 treble 1]
[nocount] a | gggg | cd [nocheck] :) |
[nocount nocheck] ef | gggg |
.endd
.index "bars" "count of"
.index "bar counting"
.index "counting bars"
The number of bars in each stave is included as part of the information that
appears as a result of specifying &%-v%& on the PMW command line (&R;
&<<SECTinfo>>&). The count is given as the number of bars that do not contain
&%[nocount]%&, followed by the number of bars that do contain &%[nocount]%&, if
any, enclosed in parentheses and preceded by a plus sign. The count for the
example above would be `3(+2)'.




.section "Dimensions"
.index "dimensions"
.index "point, definition of"
The unit of length used by PMW is the printer's &'point'&. Historically the
size of this has varied, but a value of 1/72 of an inch is now established as
the standard in digital publishing. One millimetre is 2.835 points. Whenever a
dimension is required in a PMW directive, its units are always points.
.code
linelength 720
.endd
This example specifies a line length of 720 points, that is, 10 inches. PMW
works internally in millipoints (thousandths of a point), and any dimension can
be given with a decimal point and a fractional part, though any digits after
the third decimal place are ignored.
.code
barlinespace 3.5
.endd
This example specifies that the horizontal space after bar lines should be 3.5
points.
.index "magnification"
When the output is being magnified (or reduced), dimensions specified by the
user refer to the unmagnified (or unreduced) units, with the exception of the
line length, page length, sheet depth, and sheet width, which are always in
absolute units. For example, if the line length is set to 480 points, it
remains 480 points at a magnification of 1.5, but if the distance between
staves is set to 50 points, the staves are actually positioned 75 points apart
at this magnification. This means that a change of magnification does not
require dimensions in the input to be changed.

The following dimension information (in points) is given to help users who
want to position items manually on the page:

.itable none 0 0 2  190 left  20 right
.row "distance between stave lines" "4"
.row "width of noteheads" "6"
.row "default text baseline level below stave" "10"
.row "default text baseline level above stave" "4"
.endtable

.index "notes" "width of head"
.index "width" "of notehead"
.index "text" "baseline level"
The solid vertical line of the bracket that is used to join the staves of a
system together is 2 points wide. This is another useful reference when
trying to make dimensional judgements.



.section "Paper size" SECTpapersizes
.index "paper size"
.index "size" "of paper"
.index "A3, A4, A5 paper size"
.index "B5 paper size"
.index "letter, paper size"
.index "&%sheetwidth%&"
.index "&%sheetdepth%&"
.index "&%sheetsize%&"
By default, PMW assumes that printing is to take place on A4 paper and so
it creates a page image appropriate to that size. If a different paper size is
required, the &%sheetwidth%& and &%sheetdepth%& directives can be used to
specify what its dimensions are. For standard paper sizes, it is not normally
necessary to use &%sheetwidth%& and &%sheetdepth%&, because the &%sheetsize%&
directive, which takes as its argument one of the words `A3', `A4', `A5',
`B5', or `letter', can be used instead. This has the effect of setting the
sheet width and depth to the correct values for the given size. It also sets
the page length and line length parameters to appropriate default values for
the paper size, but these can be changed by subsequent appearances of the
&%linelength%& or &%pagelength%& directives. &%Sheetsize%& should therefore be
given at the top of the file before any use of &%linelength%& or
&%pagelength%&, and also before any use of the &%landscape%& directive. All the
&%sheet%&... directives may appear only in the first movement of a file.

In the most common case, the page image size fits the size of paper being used,
but PMW does also support &'two-up'& printing, in which two page images are
put next to each other on a larger piece of paper, for certain paper sizes.
Details of this are given in chapter &<<CHAPrunningpmw>>&.


.section "MIDI output" SECTmidi
.index "MIDI" "output"
MIDI output is intended for `proof-hearing' a piece, to check that the input is
correct. It does not try to reproduce all the nuances of a performance. In
particular, most accents and ornaments on notes have no effect, with just a few
exceptions that work in common cases. These are: trills on single notes (for
example, &`e\tr\`&), notes or chords marked with tremolo lines (for example,
&`g\//\`&), and &%[tremolo]%& between two notes or chords, all of which, by
default, are `played' as a number of shorter notes/chords. However, this is not
always satisfactory for tremolos, so there are directives to disable it (&R;
&<<SUBSECTmiditremolo>>&).

A number of other directives whose names all start with `midi' are available
for controlling the allocation of MIDI voices and channels to staves. The
&%midichannel%& (&R; &<<SUBSECTmidichannel>>&) header directive is used to
specify the allocation of a MIDI voice and/or particular PMW staves to a MIDI
channel, and the &%[midichannel]%& (&R; &<<SUBSECTmidichannelST>>&),
&%[midivoice]%& (&R; &<<SUBSECTmidivoice>>&), and &%[midipitch]%& (&R;
&<<SUBSECTmidipitch>>&) directives are used to change the setup in the middle
of a piece. For percussion staves, where the playing pitch selects different
instruments, the &%[printpitch]%& (&R; &<<SUBSECTprintpitch>>&) directive can
be used to force the visible notes to a single pitch.

If the input file contains no MIDI-specific directives, all notes are played
through MIDI channel 1. The voice allocation on the channel is not changed, so
whatever MIDI voice is assigned to the channel is used. The `velocity'
parameter for each note corresponds to the volume setting, since `velocity'
controls the volume on many MIDI instruments. If relative volumes are set by
means of the &%midivolume%& (&R; &<<SUBSECTmidivolume>>&) or &%[midivolume]%&
(&R; &<<SUBSECTmidivolumeST>>&) directives, the overall volume is multiplied by
the relative volume and then divided by 15 (the maximum relative volume). Thus,
for example, if the overall volume is 64 and a stave has a relative volume of
10, its notes are played with a `velocity' of 42.

Notes that are suppressed by the use of &%[notes off]%& are by default also
omitted from MIDI output. The header directive &%midifornotesoff%& can be used
to change this behaviour.



.section "Headings and footings"
.index "footing" "new movement"
.index "heading" "new movement"
There are three different sets of heading/footing directives:
.ilist
&%heading%& and &%footing%& specify text that appears once, on the first page
of a piece or at the start of a new movement.
.next
&%pageheading%& and &%pagefooting%& specify text for the second and subsequent
pages of a piece or movement.
.next
&%lastfooting%& specifies text for the final page of a piece or (by request) at
the end of a movement.
.endlist
Page headings and footings persist from movement to movement, but new ones can
be specified if required. New page headings and footings completely replace
those of the previous movement, and are used at the first page break of the new
movement. For all movements, if no &%footing%& is given, but there is a
&%pagefooting%& (either given for the movement or carried on from the previous
one), the page footing appears at the bottom of the first page as well as on
all subsequent pages.

One exception to the above is when a new movement continues on the same page as
one or more previous movements. If a &%footing%& was specified for a previous
movement but has not yet been used (in other words, this is still the first
page of that movement) and the subsequent movements do not themselves have
overriding &%footing%& directives, that footing appears on the page. If, for
example, a copyright footing is defined at the start of the first movement, it
will appear at the bottom of the first page, even if the second movement starts
on that page, provided the second movement does not itself contain any
&%footing%& directives.

If the start of a new movement coincides with the top of a new page, the page
heading is followed by the heading for the new movement. This means that, for
example, if page numbers are specified in the first movement by a
&%pageheading%& directive, they will appear by default on all subsequent pages.
.index "movement" "suppressing page heading"
Sometimes page headings need to be suppressed at the start of a new movement,
for example if they are being used to show the name of the movement at the top
of each page. This can be done by adding the keyword `nopageheading' to the
&%[newmovement]%& directive:
.code
[newmovement nopageheading]
.endd
This option can be used with or without the `newpage' option; it takes effect
only if the new movement actually starts at the top of a page, and it applies
only to the one movement. When a new movement does start at the top of a page
there is sometimes a requirement for a special footing on the last page of the
preceding movement. This can be requested by the use of:
.code
[newmovement uselastfooting]
.endd
This causes PMW to use the &%lastfooting%& setting for this purpose and also
applies to just the one movement. The value of &%lastfooting%& can be reset in
the new movement if necessary.




.section "Horizontal and vertical justification"
.index "justification"
.index "horizontal justification"
.index "vertical justification"
The word `justification' is used in a typesetting context to describe the way
in which a line of text is arranged within its boundaries. `Left justified'
means that the line begins hard up against the left-hand edge; `right
justified' means it is hard up against the right-hand edge. If both left and
right justification are required, the line must be stretched out so that it
fits exactly between the boundaries. There is also a concept of `vertical
justification', in which the lines of a page are spread out so that the page is
exactly filled, instead of leaving blank space at the bottom.

In typesetting music, similar considerations apply, with music systems taking
the place of lines. Normally, systems are stretched to fill out the entire
width required, but there are occasions when this is not required, or would
look silly because the line is very short. Similarly, it is often necessary to
spread systems vertically so that the bottom stave is at the same level on each
page. PMW supports both horizontal and vertical justification. By default, both
are enabled, but the &%justify%& and &%[justify]%& directives allow the user to
control the justification of each page and each system if required. The
&%topmargin%& and &%bottommargin%& directives offer some further flexibility in
the page layout.



.section "Key signatures" SECTkeysig
.index "key signatures" "specifying"
.index "accidentals" "in key signatures"
Standard key signatures are specified by key letter, followed by a PMW
accidental character if necessary, and then possibly the letter &`m`& to
indicate a minor key. PMW uses the sharp character (&`#`&) to indicate a sharp,
but because there is nothing resembling a flat on a computer keyboard, the key
that is adjacent to sharp on some keyboards, the dollar sign (&`$`&), is used.
All the standard key signatures are supported.

.itable none 0 0 2  30 left 200 left
.row &`a`&       "means A major"
.row &`c#m`&     "means C sharp minor"
.row &`B$`&      "means B flat major"
.row &`CM`&      "means C minor"
.endtable

There is in addition a pseudo-key N, which behaves like C major except that it
does not transpose. See the next section for a discussion of key signatures
after transposition, and the &%printkey%& directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTprintkey>>&)
for how to output key signatures in non-standard ways.

PMW also supports up to 10 custom key signatures called &`X1`& to &`X10`& which
are defined by the &%makekey%& directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTmakekey>>&). This can
specify arbitrary accidentals, including half-accidentals and double
accidentals, at any position on the stave.


.section "Transposition" SECTtransposition
.index "transposition"
Octave transposition can be specified for each stave, to simplify the input
notation. See the &%[octave]%& and the various clef directives (&%[treble]%&,
&%[bass]%&, etc). In addition, general transposition can be specified for the
whole piece or for individual staves. PMW can transpose up or down by any
number of semitones less than 61 (5 octaves). A transposition for the whole
piece can be specified externally, via the &%-t%& command line option, or
within the input file by the &%transpose%& header directive. Transposition for
individual staves is specified with &%[transpose]%&. If more than one
transposition is present, the effect is cumulative.

.index "transposition" "key signatures"
.index "key signatures" "after transposition"
PMW transposes key signatures as well as notes, but there is a special
pseudo-key N that does not transpose. This is described below. Custom key
signatures (&`X1`& to &`X10`&) can be transposed, but additional information,
supplied by one or more &%keytranspose%& directives (&R;
&<<SUBSECTkeytranspose>>&), must be supplied for this to work.

A piece that is to be transposed should be input with its original key
signature(s) specified in the usual way. When &%[transpose]%& is used to
transpose a single stave, only those key signatures that follow the directive
in the input are transposed. When transposing a non-custom key signature, the
key F&sharp; major is used in transposed output only if specially requested via
the &%transposedkey%& directive, G&flat; being used by default. A number of
other keys are also not used by default but can be specially requested. The
complete list is as follows:

.itable none 0 0 5  16 left  30 left  110 centre  18 left  50 left
.row C&flat;  "major"   "instead of the default"  B        "major"
.row C&sharp; "major"   """"                      D&flat;  "major"
.row F&sharp; "major"   """"                      G&flat;  "major"
.row A&flat;  "minor"   """"                      G&sharp; "minor"
.row A&sharp; "minor"   """"                      B&flat;  "minor"
.row D&sharp; "minor"   """"                      E&flat;  "minor"
.endtable

The &%transposedkey%& directive also has uses when transposing music in which
the key signature has fewer accidentals than the tonality.

.index "accidentals" "transposed"
Except when using the pseudo-key N, if a note is specified with an accidental,
an accidental will always be present by default after transposition, whether or
not it is strictly necessary. This ensures that `cautionary accidentals' are
preserved over transposition. There is an option to suppress this action for
individual notes, and the &%[transposedacc]%& and &%transposedacc%& directives
can be used to suppress it within a part or throughout a piece, respectively.


.subsection "The non-transposing pseudo-key N" SUBSECTtransposeN
.index "transposition" "non-transposing key"
.index "key signatures" "non-transposing"
.index "key N"
There are some instruments (transposing brass for example) whose parts are
often set with no key signatures. This can, of course, be typeset by specifying
C major, but if such a part is transposed, it may acquire an unwanted key
signature. To avoid this, PMW supports a pseudo-key N, which behaves like C
major, except that it does not transpose. It can only be specified on its own,
that is, not with a following accidental or &`m`&.

When key N is in force, notes transpose as usual. The choice of accidental for
the new note is influenced by what C major would require. However, there are
some special rules that apply only to this kind of transposition.

.ilist
If the new note's accidental is redundant, discard it, except in one specific
circumstance: when a note that is notated with a natural is the first non-tied
note in the bar. The reasoning behind this is that the original natural must be
`cautionary'. Apart from this special case, the behaviour is as if
&%[transposedacc noforce]%& has been applied. However, an accidental can
be forced for individual notes by following the original accidental with
&`^+`&, for example &`#^+a`&.
.next
Do not use double sharps or double flats unless the original note had
a double sharp or double flat, respectively.
.next
Convert new notes E&sharp; and B&sharp; into F and C, respectively.
.next
Convert new notes C&flat; and F&flat; into B and E respectively.
.endlist


.subsection "Transposition of key and chord names"
.index "transposition" "chord names"
.index "transposition" "key names"
PMW can automatically transpose the names of standard keys and chords in text
strings. This is achieved by means of a special escape sequence &`\t`&.
.code
"Sonata in \tE$"
.endd
In this example, the sequence &`\tE$`& is replaced by E&flat; when no
transposition is taking place and by F when a transposition of +2 is set. Full
details of string escape sequences, including key and chord name transpostion,
are given in section &<<SECTtextstrings>>&.



.section "Time signatures" SECTtimesig
.index "time signatures" "specifying"
Time signatures are specified by separating two numbers with a slash. For
example, 3/4 specifies waltz time. PMW imposes no limitations on the values of
the numbers used in time signatures. There are two special time signatures that
are specified as letters:
.ilist
.index "common time"
The letter &`C`& specifies `common time' &-- equivalent to 4/4 but output
using the conventional character &{{^}}&.
.next
.index "alla breve"
The letter &`A`& specifies `alla breve' &-- equivalent to 2/2 but output
using the conventional `cut time' character &{{_}}&.
.endlist
A time signature can be preceded by a number and an asterisk. This has the
effect of multiplying the number of notes in the bar for the purposes of
checking bar lengths. However, the time signature is output as given. Thus,
for example, the time signature &`2*C`& is shown as &{{^}}&, but expects there
to be four minims rather than four crotchets in a bar, and &`2*3/4`& is shown
as 3/4 but expects three minims in a bar.

There are options for suppressing time signatures at various places, and the
&%printtime%& directive can be used to specify exactly how certain time
signatures are to be shown. For example, 8/8 could appear as 3+3+2/8, or only a
single, large number could be used.

By default, numerical time signatures use the bold font. However, the
&%timefont%& header directive can specify an alternative. In addition, if
&%printtime%& is used, the normal font-changing escape sequences can be used in
the strings.

PMW can handle music where different staves have different time signatures. For
compatible cases such as 3/4 &'vs'& 6/8 no special action is necessary. For
other cases (for example, 2/4 &'vs'& 6/8) the &%[time]%& stave directive has to
be used to specify the conversion.



.section "Incipits" SECTincipit
.index "incipits"
The word &'incipit'& is the name given to stave notation that appears before
the first bar of a piece, as commonly seen in scholarly editions. This notation
is often used to show the original clef and other information about the piece.
Here is a typical example:

.music "music18" 64 8,-20

This example was produced by using the &%startbracketbar%& directive to
`indent' the joining bracket by one bar. It also uses the masquerade facility
(&R; &<<SUBSECTmasquerade>>&) to output a semibreve in the place of a minim, an
invisible rest &`q`& (&R; &<<SUBSECTrests>>&) and an invisible bar line &`|?`&
(&R; &<<SUBSECTinvisbar>>&) to generate extensions to the stave lines, and
&%[nocheck]%& to disable bar length checks where necessary. The input is as
follows:
.code
startbracketbar 1
unfinished
[stave 1 soprano 1 key F time C nocheck]
A | [treble 1 key a$ time c] Rc'd' | [nocheck] q |?
[endstave]
[stave 2 tenor 1 key F time C nocheck]
C\M+\ | [treble 1 key a$ time c] Ead' | [nocheck] q |?
[endstave]
.endd
If an incipit is required on one stave only, for example, for a single voice
introduction at the start of a liturgical item, the other staves can be
completely suppressed by making use of the &%omitempty%& option of the
&%[stave]%& directive. For example, changing the second stave above:
.code
[stave 2 omitempty]
| @ An empty bar
[treble 1 key a$ time c] Ead' | [nocheck] q |?
[endstave]
.endd

.music "music61" 64 8,-20

Another style of incipit leaves blank space between the incipit stave and the
start of the piece proper. With a little bit of trickery, PMW can cope with
this as well. The incipit and the rest of the piece must be input as separate
`movements', separated by &%[newmovement thisline]%&. The incipit movement
must be specified as left justified, and the start of the next movement as
right justified, switching to left and right justification on the second
system. If necessary, &%[newline]%& can be used to control the number of bars
in the first system.


.section "Text fonts" SECTtextfonts
.index "text" "fonts"
.index "fonts" "names of"
.index "naming fonts"
.index "font names"
PMW supports the use of a number of different fonts, or typefaces, for use in
text strings. As well as the standard four (roman, italic, bold face, and bold
italic), the use of a symbol font and of the music font is supported. In
addition, up to twelve other fonts can be defined by the user. The different
kinds of text (for example, underlay or bar numbers) each have a default font,
and there are directives to change these. The &%textfont%& header directive
(&R; &<<SUBSECTtextfont>>&) is used to define exactly which fonts correspond to
these names:

.itable none 0 0 2  90 left  200 left
.row "&`roman`&"          "the roman font"
.row "&`italic`&"         "the &'italic'& font"
.row "&`bold`&"           "the &*bold face*& font"
.row "&`bolditalic`&"     "the &*&'bold italic'&*& font"
.row "&`symbol`&"         "the symbol font"
.row "&`extra`& <&'n'&>"  "the <&'n'&>th extra font"
.endtable

The music font can be changed by &%musicfont%&, but this is likely to be of use
only to PMW maintainers. By default, the &'Times'& series of fonts are used for
text, and the &'Symbol'& font for symbols.

.index "fonts" "metrics"
PMW needs access to the `fontmetrics' (&`.afm`&) file of every text font that
it uses. Fontmetrics files for the standardly available PostScript and PDF
fonts are supplied with PMW. If you want to use other fonts, you will need to
obtain the appropriate fontmetrics files and install them in PMW's
&%fontmetrics%& directory, or use the &*-F*& command line option (see below).
You may also want to supply Unicode translation files (&R;
&<<SUBSECTunitrans>>&). These can alter a font's encoding and define
translations from Unicode code points to code points within the font. The
encoding defines which of a font's characters are accessible via numerical code
points. PMW supports up to 512 characters per font.

If the font you want to use does not have a fontmetrics file, you can create
one in various ways. For example, there is a utility called &'ttf2afm'& that
generates AFM files for TrueType fonts. The &'FontForge'& open source font
editor can create AFM files for any font that it can load. Some fonts contain
thousands of characters, resulting in large AFM files. These are readable text
files, and you can reduce the amount of work PMW has to do by cutting out any
unwanted characters.

PMW's &%-F%& command line option can be used to provide a list of additional
directories to be searched for any files relating to fonts: AFM files
(&`.afm`&), Unicode translation files (&`.utr`&), and font files (&`.otf`&,
&`.pfa`&, &`.pfb`&). These directories are searched first, before those that
are installed with PMW.


.section "Font handling for PDF output"
.index "fonts" "PDF output"
.index "PDF" "font handling"
There are fourteen `standard' fonts that every PDF processor must make
available: the Times, Helvetica, and Courier families, plus Symbol and
ZapfDingbats. PMW assumes that these are available, and you can use them
without any special action. If you want to use a non-standard font, not only
must you make available its AFM file (as mentioned above), but the font itself
must be made known to PMW so that it can be included in the output. When
generating PDF output, only OpenType (&`.otf`&) fonts are supported. Other
kinds of font can be converted to OpenType by tools such as those found in
Adobe's AFDKO font development kit for OpenType.


.section "Font handling for PostScript output"
.index "fonts" "PostScript output"
.index "PostScript" "font handling"
PostScript has 35 `standard' fonts that you can use without the need to take
special action. If you want to use a non-standard font, you must make its AFM
file available to PMW (as discussed above). By default, PMW will not include
the font itself in its PostScript output &-- you will need to make it available
to the PostScript processor that you are using in the same way as for PMW's
music font (&R; &<<SECTsetup>>&). You can, however, cause PMW to include the
font in the output by specifying `include' in the &%textfont%& header directive
(&R; &<<SUBSECTtextfont>>&). If you do this, the font must be made known to PMW
via the &%-F%& option.


.section "Font sizes, aspect ratios, and shearing" SECTfontsize
.index "fonts" "sizes"
.index "aspect ratio of fonts"
.index "fonts" "aspect ratio"
.index "sheared fonts"
.index "fonts" "shearing"
Many PMW directives allow you to specify a size for a font. For example, when
defining a heading:
.code
heading 15 "|Sonatina" 30
.endd
The first number (15) specifies a 15-point font.
.index "text" "aspect ratio"
.index "text" "sizes"
.index "text" "shearing"
There are further parameters to control the size and shape of any text font.
These are coded as two additional numbers, separated from the main size value
by slashes:
.code
heading 15/1.3/10 "|Sonatina" 30
.endd
The first additional number is a horizontal stretching factor that alters
the aspect ratio of the font. If it is greater than one, the resulting font
appears short and fat; if it is less than one, the appearance is tall and thin.
Stretching a font horizontally makes it look larger without using up any more
vertical space.

.music "music30" 38

The second additional number is a shearing angle, measured in degrees. It
specifies the angle between the true vertical and what were originally vertical
lines in the font. A positive shear angle causes the font to slope to the
right, and a negative one makes it slope to the left. Sheared roman fonts are
sometimes used instead of italic fonts:
.code
heading 14/1/20 "Slanted text"
.endd
In this example, the heading font has a 20&deg; shear.

.music "music31" 12 0,-2

Stretching and shearing values can be specified in all the places where a text
font size can be specified.



.section "Text strings" SECTtextstrings
.index "strings" "general form of"
.index "text" "strings"
Text strings (often just called `strings') are used in a number of different
places in PMW to define text that appears on the page with the music. They must
always be enclosed in double-quote characters. There is no limit to the length
of a string.
.index "special characters in strings"
.index "strings" "special characters"
Three characters are treated specially in all strings:
.ilist
The single quote character &`&#39;`& and the grave accent character &```& are
converted into typographic closing and opening quote characters, respectively,
in fonts whose fontmetrics file specifies the Adobe standard encoding. This is
the case for all the default fonts except the music and symbol fonts. A closing
quote character is the same as an apostrophe.
.next
The backslash character &`\`& is an &'escape character'&. Amongst other things,
it can be used to include specially treated characters, including itself, as
literals in a string (&R; &<<SUBSECTescaped>>&).
.endlist
There are also some characters that are treated specially only in some specific
types of string:
.ilist
In vocal underlay or overlay strings, &`#`& (sharp), &`-`& (hyphen), &`=`&
(equals), and &`^`& (circumflex) are treated specially (&R; &<<SECTunderlay>>&).
.next
.index "vertical bar in strings"
.index "strings" "vertical bar"
.index "| (vertical bar) in strings"
In headings and footings, the vertical bar &`|`& serves to separate the
left-hand, middle and right-hand parts of the text. In text that appears at
the start of a stave, it serves to delimit individual lines.
.endlist
A backslash can be used to remove the special meaning from any of these
characters.

In chapter &<<CHAPunifont>>& there is a list of the characters in fonts that
use the Adobe standard encoding. These characters are accessible using UTF-8 or
escape sequences in text strings. There are, of course, many other characters
that are defined in Unicode, but which are not present in these fonts. Some of
them (for example, Greek letters) exist in the &'Symbol'& font.

For fonts that do not use the Adobe standard encoding, you can use Unicode code
points only if a file that translates from Unicode to the font's own encoding
is available (&R; &<<SUBSECTunitrans>>&). If not, you are restricted to the
font's 256 code points.



.subsection "Unicode and UTF-8 encoding" SUBSECTuniutf
.index "Unicode"
.index "UTF-8 encoding"
.index "ISO-8859-1"
.index "character codes" "discussion of"
.index "strings" "encoding"
This section is rather technical. Unless you need to know some of the deep
details of character handling or font encodings, you can ignore it and the
following two sections, and skip to section &<<SUBSECTescaped>>& &'Escaped
characters'& below.

Basic fonts in PostScript programs and PDF files can display up to 256
characters, many more than are available on a computer's keyboard. The original
computer character set, often referred to as ASCII, comprises 95 characters
(including space), whose code values lie between 32 and 126, inclusive. These
are the characters you can type on the keyboard. Codes less than 32, together
with code 127, are used for control functions such as `newline' and `delete'.
Codes greater than 127 are not defined in the ASCII character set.

When people needed more than 95 characters, a number of different codes were
defined, including several called ISO-8859-&'n'& (for different values of
&'n'&). These all kept the same meanings for codes 0&--127, but added different
sets of characters for the values 128&--255. The most widely used of these
codes is ISO-8859-1 (`Latin1'), which contains many of the accented characters
used in Western European languages.

The problem with using many different character codes is that it is hard to
switch between them. Even for music, where there is not much text, the name of
the composer may be in one language, requiring a certain set of accents, and
the rest of the text may be in another, requiring different accents. The
long-term solution to this problem is Unicode, which is a single encoding for
all the world's characters. Unicode character values are no longer constrained
to lie in the range 0&--255, thus enabling the character sets from many
languages to be simultaneously defined. However, this means that no longer can
every character fit into one byte of memory.

The Unicode encoding copies ISO-8859-1 for the first 256 characters.
Furthermore, there is a way of encoding these characters called UTF-8 which
keeps the byte values 0&--127 as the encoding for those character values. For
character codes greater than 127, a multibyte encoding is defined. If a file
consists of bytes containing only the original 127 ASCII values, it is a valid
UTF-8 encoded Unicode file. From version 4.10 onwards, PMW treats the bytes
that make up quoted strings as UTF-8 encoded Unicode character sequences. For
example, the following byte sequence (where each byte is expressed in
hexadecimal) encodes two characters:
.code
41 C2 A6
.endd
The first byte, with a decimal value of 65, is less than 128, and is therefore
an entire character on its own. The remaining two bytes together encode the
value 166. If you have a text editor that can create files using UTF-8 encoding
for Unicode characters, you can use these characters directly in PMW strings.
If not, you can refer to characters whose values are greater than 127 using
escape sequences, as described in section &<<SUBSECTescaped>>& below.

&*Historical Note:*& Before release 4.10, PMW interpreted each byte in a text
string as a single character, with a value in the range 0&--255. Values less
than 128 were interpreted as ASCII, and values in the range 160&--255 were
taken from ISO-8859-1. Some of the values in the range 128&--159 were subverted
for additional characters such as en-dash and em-dash that are not defined in
ISO-8859-1. In addition, access to non-ASCII characters was available via
escape sequences so that a PMW input file could contain only ASCII bytes and
still use all the ISO-8859-1 characters, though in practice input files in
ISO-8859-1 code were used.




.subsection "Font encoding and Unicode translation files" SUBSECTunitrans
.index "Unicode" "translation files"
.index "&`.utr`& file extension
.index "fonts" "encoding"
.index "fonts" "Unicode translation"
.index "fonts" "metrics"
A font may contain any number of characters, identified by name, but only 256
are accessible by code point. The mapping between code points and character
names is the font's &'encoding'&. Each font has a default encoding for up to
256 characters, but this can be changed. PMW actually sets up two fonts for
each text font, so as to make 512 code points available for each PMW font. From
the user's point of view, each text font can handle characters whose code
points are in the range 0&--511.

Fonts whose fontmetrics files specify Adobe standard encoding contain a known
set of around 350 characters (they may contain others as well). For such fonts
PMW sets up an encoding that makes all these standard characters accessible via
Unicode code points (&R; &<<CHAPunifont>>&). The first 384 code points
(0&--383) in the PMW &'virtual font'& are directly encoded to match Unicode.
The remaining 44 standard characters have Unicode code points that are greater
than 511 (U+01FF). PMW handles these by encoding them starting at code point
384 and arranging an automatic translation from their high-valued Unicode code
points. The remaining code points in the virtual font are undefined.

Fonts whose fontmetrics files do not specify Adobe standard encoding contain an
unknown set of characters. Without additional data the only characters that are
accessible are those in the font's default encoding, using code points in the
range 0&--255. Code points in the range 256&--511 default to duplicates of the
lower range.

&'Unicode translation files'& can be used to modify the encoding arrangements
just described, and can also be used to set up custom character translations.
When PMW loads a font, it looks for an optional &`.utr`& file in the same
directories that are searched for fontmetrics (&`.afm`&) files (see the &*-F*&
command line option). A  &`.utr`& file can do three things, and its format is
very simple:
.ilist
In each line, leading white space is ignored.
.next
Empty lines and lines that start with &`#`& are ignored.
.next
A line that begins with a slash defines an encoding value that modifies the
default encoding. The format is:
.display
/<&'character name'&> <&'code point'&> <&'optional comment'&>
.endd
The code point can be specified in decimal, hexadecimal preceded by &`0x`&, or
octal starting with &`0`&. It must be in the range 0&--511. These examples come
from an Arabic font:
.code
/uni0627 65   ALEF
/uni0622 336  ALEF with MADDA ABOVE
.endd
In this font, character names are based on Unicode code points. U+0627 is the
ALEF character; here it is being encoded as character 65, with an accented
version as character 336. Code points that are not mentioned in the &`.utr`&
file are unchanged.
.next
A line that starts with a question mark specifies the Unicode character to
substitute when an unsupported Unicode code point is encountered. The rest of
the line is an optional comment. For example:
.code
?  35  Use code 35 for unknowns
.endd
.next
Other lines specify a translation from a Unicode code point to a code point
within the font. They must start with a space-terminated hexadecimal number,
optionally preceded by &`U+`& or &`0x`&, followed by the corresponding font
code point, for example:
.code
0627 65   ALEF
fe8d 65   ALEF ISOLATED FORM
0622 336  ALEF with MADDA ABOVE
.endd
As this example shows, more than one Unicode code point can be mapped to the
same font code point.
.endlist

If a Unicode code point greater than U+01FF is encountered that is neither
handled by the standard encoding mechanism described above nor handled by a
translation file, it is replaced by the font's `unknown character' code, and
a warning is issued.

Unicode translation files with the extension &`.utr`& are provided for the
&'Symbol'& font and also for the PMW-Music font, though only a small number
of characters in the latter correspond to Unicode code points.



.subsection "Backwards compatibility for character strings" SUBSECTbackcompat
.index "ISO-8859-1"
.index "character codes" "backwards compatibility"
Some byte values are invalid in UTF-8 strings. In particular, a single byte
with a value greater than 127 that is between two bytes whose values are less
than 128 cannot occur. When PMW encounters such a byte in a string, it
interprets it as a single-byte encoding of a character in the range 128&--255.
This is done for backwards compatibility so that input files for PMW releases
prior to 4.10 that made use of the ISO-8859-1 encoding directly can still be
processed. From release 5.00 a warning is issued if any such character is
encountered. The output is likely to be correct in most cases; only when there
are several high-valued bytes in a row, and they happen to form a valid UTF-8
character, will things go wrong.



.subsection "Escaped characters" SUBSECTescaped
.index "escaped characters"
.index "backslash"
.index "\ (escape) character"
.index "strings" "escaped characters"
.index "strings" "accented characters"
.index "accented characters in strings"
.index "strings" "special characters"
.index "special characters in strings"
From PMW release 4.10 onwards you can use UTF-8 encoding to directly represent
Unicode character values in text strings. However, it is also possible to use
just the set of ASCII characters in PMW input files, without loss of
functionality. The backslash character is used as a means of including
characters that are not on the computer keyboard, for specifying changes of
font, and for some other special effects. For example, the following sequences
are available to represent some of the commonly accented characters in European
languages:

.itable none 0 0 2  40 left  300 left
.row &`\a'`&   "codes for &nbsp;&aacute;"
.row &`\a``&   "codes for &nbsp;&agrave;"
.row &`\a^`&   "codes for &nbsp;&acirc;"
.row &`\a.`&   "codes for &nbsp;&auml;"

.endtable
Many other accented characters are available, and there are other escape
sequences for other special characters:

.itable none 0 0 3  40 left  68 left 300 left
.row &`\c)`&   "codes for &nbsp;&copy;"
.row &`\c]`&   "codes for &nbsp;&copy;"   "(but see below)"
.row &`\ss`&   "codes for &nbsp;&szlig;"
.row &`\?`&    "codes for &nbsp;&iquest;"
.row &`\\`&    "codes for &nbsp;\"
.row &`\"`&    "codes for &nbsp;&#34;"    "(because &`&#34;`& on its own terminates the string)"
.row &`\'`&    "codes for &nbsp;&#39;"    "(because &`&#39;`& on its own codes for ' )"
.row &`\``&    "codes for &nbsp;&#96;"    "(because &```& on its own codes for ` )"
.row &`\<<`&   "codes for &nbsp;&#x201C;"
.row &`\>>`&   "codes for &nbsp;&#x201D;"
.row &`\--`&   "codes for &nbsp;&--"
.row &`\---`&  "codes for &nbsp;&mdash;"
.endtable

.index "copyright symbol"
The normal way to include a copyright symbol in a string is to use &`\c)`&
because this obtains it from the current font. However, some older PostScript
printers do not have a copyright symbol in every font. The alternative escape
sequence &`\c]`& is provided to use the copyright symbol from the &'Symbol'&
font.

A complete list of all the available special characters and their escape
sequences is given in chapter &<<CHAPunifont>>&. Other escape sequences are
summarized in chapter &<<CHAPsyntaxsummary>>&. Characters that are not on the
keyboard can also be included in strings by giving the character number, in
hexadecimal preceded by &`x`& or in decimal, enclosed between two backslashes.
For example, &`\xb7\`& or &`\183\`& is a bullet character.

The interpretation of string escape sequences happens when a string is first
read. This means that characters that are interpreted in underlay text and
elsewhere are always recognized as special, however they are coded. For
example, if a vertical bar in a heading is entered as &`\124\`& it is still
recognized as a left/centre/right separator. If you need one of these
characters to appear without interpretation, you can escape it with a
backslash. For example, &`\|`& encodes a literal vertical bar.

&*Note:*& This is a change from the way strings were handled in releases prior
to 5.00. In earlier releases escapes were processed later, after checking for
special characters.

.index "Symbol font"
.index "fonts" "Symbol"
Characters from the &'Symbol'& font are available for use in text strings. This
font contains some large brackets that are sometimes useful, as well as a
number of other special characters that are not present in the ordinary text
fonts. Since release 4.35, Unicode encoding can be used for this font because a
translation file from Unicode code points to the font's own code points is now
provided. Code points less that 256 that are not in the translation file are
output unchanged.

To include a single character from the Symbol font without affecting the font
of subsequent characters, specify its hexadecimal character number preceded by
&`sx`&, or its decimal character number preceded by &`s`&, enclosed in
backslashes. For example, &`\s174\`& is
.index "right arrow symbol"
the &rarr; right arrow symbol. This could also be given as &`\sx2192\`&, which
is the Unicode code point.


.subsection "Page numbers"
.index "page numbers"
.index "numbering pages"
There are some escape sequences that are different to the others in that they
do not generate a particular fixed character:

.itable none 0 0 2  50 left  300 left
.row &`\p\`&    "inserts the current page number"
.row &`\po\`&   "inserts the current page number if it is odd"
.row &`\pe\`&   "inserts the current page number if it is even"
.endtable

If the page number is even, &`\po\`& inserts nothing, and if it is odd,
&`\pe\`& inserts nothing. These are made available for use in heading and
footing lines, to enable page numbers to be placed on the right or left as
appropriate. There is an additional facility for skipping parts of the string
depending on the value of the page number. Any characters between two
occurrences of the substring &`\so\`& are skipped if the page number is odd,
and similarly for &`\se\`& if the page number is even. This makes it possible
to specify page headings of this form:
.code
pageheading "\so\page \p\\so\||\se\page \p\\se\"
.endd
This example outputs `page &'n'&' on the left or right of the page, depending
on the value of the page number. The effect of &`\so\`& followed by &`\se\`& or
&'vice versa'& is undefined.



.subsection "Numbering repeated bars"
.index "numbering repeated bars"
.index "repeated bars" "numbering"
There is a facility for requesting the same bar to be repeated multiple times.
In text strings in such bars, the escape sequence &`\r\`& is replaced by the
repetition number. For more details, see section &<<SECTrepeatbars>>&.



.subsection "Transposing key and chord names" SUBSECTtranchordnames
.index "transposition" "chord names"
.index "transposition" "key names"
A special escape sequence is provided to define the names of keys or chords
that should be changed by transposition. This makes it straightforward to
transpose pieces that show chord names above a line of music or include a key
name in the title. The feature applies only to the names of standard keys;
there is no support for custom keys or half accidentals.

The escape sequence is &`\t`&, and it must be followed by one of the letters
A&--G, in upper case. This may optionally be followed by one of the accidental
characters &`#`&, &`$`&, or &`%`&. Such a sequence has two effects; firstly,
the key or chord name is transposed in the same way as its base note would be
transposed, and secondly, if the new name involves a sharp or a flat, the
correct sign is used, with appropriate spacing adjustment. Thus, even without
transposition, this notation is a convenient way of specifying key or chord
names that involve accidentals.

Natural signs are never used on transposed names. The rules for transposing
notes can yield a new note with a double sharp or a double flat. When this
happens for a key or chord name, the enharmonic name is substituted. For
example, G is used for F double-sharp.

When a string that involves a transposable name appears in a heading or footing
line, only external transposition specified by the &%-t%& command line option
plus any &%transpose%& header directives that are earlier in file are applied
to it, because the transposition is performed when the string is read. It is
also important to specify the key signature before the transposable heading or
footing, in case it affects the result. For example, consider this directive:
.code
heading "Sonata in \tC minor"
.endd
If no key is specified before this line in an input file, and a transposition
of +1 is applied, the result is `Sonata in D&flat; minor', because PMW assumes
the key of C major. However, if the key is set to C minor before the heading
line, the result of transposing by +1 is `Sonata in C&sharp; minor'.



.subsection "The transposition setting"
.index "transposition" "inserting value"
Another use for the &`\t`& escape sequence is to insert the transposition value
into a string. In this case, &`\t`& must be followed by a backslash. For
example:
.code
heading "(Transposed by \t\ semitones)"
.endd
The insertion happens when the string is read.


.subsection "Font changes" SUBSECTfontchanges
.index "font changes"
.index "text" "font changes"
Roman, italic, bold and bold italic fonts are available for all text. By
default, these use the &'Times'& series of fonts but can be changed by the
&%textfont%& header directive. In addition, the user may define up to twelve
additional fonts via &%textfont%&. If any of these is used without being
defined, the roman font is substituted.

The initial font setting at the start of each character string is roman for all
text that is not part of any stave's data. Within a stave, the default depends
on whether the text is underlay, overlay, figured bass, or other text.
.index "figured bass" "default font"
.index "underlay" "default font"
.index "fonts" "default at string start"
For underlay, overlay, and figured bass the default is roman, but for other
text it is italic, which is appropriate for dynamic marks such as
&'crescendo'&. The default fonts for each type of text can be changed on a
per-stave basis (see the &%[underlayfont]%&, &%[overlayfont]%&, &%[fbfont]%&,
and &%[textfont]%& stave directives). Within a text string, the following
special character sequences are used to change font:

.itable none 0 0 2  50 left  300 left
.row &`\rm\`&    "change to roman"
.row &`\it\`&    "change to &'italic'&"
.row &`\bf\`&    "change to &*bold face*&"
.row &`\bi\`&    "change to &*&'bold italic'&*&"
.row &`\sc\`&    "change to &!SMALL CAPS!&"
.row &`\sy\`&    "change to the symbol font"
.row &`\mf\`&    "change to the music font at full size"
.row &`\mu\`&    "change to the music font at 0.9 size"
.row &`\xx1\`&   "change to the first extra font"
.row &mldr;
.row &`\xx12\`&  "change to the twelfth extra font"
.endtable

For example:
.code
"\rm\this is roman \it\this is italic \bf\this is bold"
.endd
Note that the letters in the escape sequences are always in lower case. A
change of typeface does not persist beyond the end of the text string in which
it appears. A quick way of accessing a smaller music font is provided because,
when mixed with normal text, music characters at full size are too large.

.index "small caps"
Changing to &!SMALL CAPS!& does not change the typeface, nor does it force
subsequent letters to be capitals; it just changes to a smaller font of the
same typeface as the current font. The effect lasts until the next font change.
The relative size of small caps can be set by the &%smallcapsize%& header
directive, whose argument should be a number between 0 and 1. The default value
is 0.7, because this makes small caps whose height is equal to the x-height of
the normal font in the &'Times'& series of fonts, and this is the usual
typographic convention. If applied to the music font, &`\sc\`& has the same
effect as using &`\mu\`&.



.subsection "Comments within strings"
.index "comments in strings"
.index "strings" "comments"
There is a facility for in-string comments. Any characters between the string
&`\@`& and the next backslash are ignored. This can be useful when an entire
piece's underlay is being input as a single, very long string. However, if such
a comment in an underlay string is surrounded by spaces, it acts as an empty
syllable.




.subsection "Sizes of text strings"
.index "size" "of text"
.index "text" "sizes"
.index "fonts" "sizes"
.index "size" "of fonts"
The header directives that specify page headings and footings allow arbitrary
font sizes to be given for those texts. Text within a stave uses 10-point fonts
by default, but there are various ways of changing this.

The &%textsizes%& header directive defines up to 20 settable text sizes, which
can be accessed by any text string within a stave by means of the &`/s`&
option. The default for all these sizes is 10 points. Whenever the size of a
text font is specified, an associated aspect ratio and/or shearing angle may
also be specified (&R; &<<SECTfontsize>>&). In addition there are 10 fixed
sizes that are accessed by &`/S`& (&R; &<<SUBSECTtextsizeoption>>&).

.index "figured bass" "default size"
.index "underlay" "default size"
.index "fonts" "default sizes"
Underlay, overlay, and figured bass have their own separate default sizes,
which are set up by header directives. All other text defaults to a settable
size that can specified by the &%[textsize]%& directive, with the ultimate
default being settable size 1.

Stave text strings that are not underlay or overlay can be rotated so that they
appear at an angle. Text at the start of a stave can be rotated so as to run
vertically instead of horizontally &-- see the description of &%[stave]%& in
section &<<SUBSECTstave>>&. More detail about text items in stave data is given
below (&R; &<<SECTtextitems>>&).




.subsection "Music characters" SUBSECTmusicchars
.index "music characters in text"
.index "notes" "in text strings"
.index "strings" "including notes"
An escape mechanism can be used to include single music `characters' in
textual output without having to change to the music font and back again.
Typical uses of this are for indicating tempo by outputting a note followed by
an equals sign and its metronome mark, or for including sharps and flats in the
names of instruments. To include a note from the music font, the following
special sequences can be used:
.index "fonts" "music in text"
.itable none 0 0 2  50 left  300 left
.row &`\*b\`&    "inserts a breve"
.row &`\*s\`&    "inserts a semibreve"
.row &`\*m\`&    "inserts a minim"
.row &`\*c\`&    "inserts a crotchet"
.row &`\*Q\`&    "inserts a quaver"
.row &`\*q\`&    "inserts a semiquaver"
.endtable
.index "\* escape sequence"
Any of the above can include a dot after the note letter to request the dotted
form of the note, for example, &`\*c.\`&. The accidental characters are
available as follows:
.index "accidentals" "in text strings"
.itable none 0 0 2  50 left  300 left
.row &`\*#\`&  "inserts a sharp"
.row &`\*$\`&  "inserts a flat"
.row &`\*%\`&  "inserts a natural"
.endtable
A typical example of a tempo mark that uses this facility might be:
.code
"\bf\Maestoso \*c\ = 60"   @ 60 crotchets per minute
.endd
This is output as:
.display
&*Maestoso *&&{5}&&* = 60*&
.endd
Music characters included in character strings with a single asterisk in this
way use a music font that is 9/10 the nominal size of the surrounding text
characters. This is an appropriate size for items such as tempo marks. Thus, if
a 10-point text font is being used, a 9-point music font is used with it. The
music font that is used for the music being typeset is a 10-point font, and it
is sometimes useful to be able to access music characters at full size. If two
asterisks are present in an escape sequence for a music character,
.index "\** escape sequence"
the character is taken from a music font that is the same size as the text
font. Since the default text fonts are the same size as the standard music
font, this gives music characters at the same size as those being used for
music on the stave.

If more than one escape sequence starting with an asterisk is required in
succession, they can all appear between a single pair of backslashes, for
example, &`\*#*c\`&. However, you cannot mix single and double asterisks
between the same pair of backslashes.

.index "non-printing music characters"
There are a number of `characters' in the music font that do not actually cause
any output. Instead they just move the current position, thus affecting the
placing of any subsequent characters. The following sequences (which may also
be used with two asterisks) access some of these special characters:
.itable none 0 0 2  50 left  300 left
.row &`\*u\`&    "moves up by 0.2 times the font's size"
.row &`\*d\`&    "moves down by 0.2 times the font's size"
.row &`\*l\`&    "moves left by 0.33 times the font's size"
.row &`\*r\`&    "moves right by 0.55 times the font's size"
.row &`\*<\`&    "moves left by 0.1 times the font's size"
.row &`\*>\`&    "moves right by 0.1 times the font's size"
.endtable

.index "strings" "use of music font"
In addition to those characters that are available via the escape sequences
just described, it is also possible to access any character from the music font
by specifying its hexadecimal character number preceded by &`x`& or just its
decimal number, preceded by one or two asterisks, between backslashes. A list
of the available characters is given in chapter &<<CHAPfont>>&. For example,
the sequence &`\*45\`& outputs a crotchet rest. This could also be specified as
the Unicode code point &`\*x1d13d\`&.

If you want to include a long sequence of characters from the music font in a
string, it is sometimes more convenient to use a font-changing escape sequence,
as described in the previous section, rather than individually escape each
character.



.subsection "Guitar chord grids" SUBSECTguitargrids
.index "guitar chord grids"
Guitar chord grids can be notated relatively straightforwardly as a string of
characters in the music font. The grid character itself (character 131) has
zero typographic width. If a guitar dot character (116, or `t') follows, it is
placed on the fourth fret mark of the first guitar string. The typographic
width of this character is set so that after it is output, the current point is
moved to the next guitar string.

Two of the special characters for moving up and down (119 and 120, that is, `w'
and `x') can be used to move between frets, and the right moving character 125
(`}') can be used to move to the next string if you do not want to output any
symbol on a string. The guitar ring (open string) and cross (silent string)
characters (117, or `u', and 183) behave exactly as the dot. To output them
above the first fret you need to move up one and a half times the normal fret
distance. This can be achieved by making use of two other special moving
characters, `|' and `~' (124 and 126), which move down and up half a fret
distance, respectively.

.music "music70" 16 10,0

The sequence &`\mu\`& switches into the music font, and \131\ is
character 131, the grid. The sequence &`xxxx~`& moves the current point up
by four and a half frets, which takes it to above the grid, where character
\183\, the `x', is output. The sequence &`|www`& moves down by three and a
half frets so that &`t`& puts a dot on the third fret of the second guitar
string. And so on...

If you want to add the names of the chords, you can give them as additional
text strings that can be separately positioned. Section &<<SECTtextitems>>&
discusses text strings in stave data. If you are going to use a lot of guitar
chords, it is most convenient to define macros for the text strings.



.subsection "Kerning" SUBSECTkerning
.index "text" "kerning"
.index "kerning"
&'Kerning'& is the word used to describe the practice of moving certain pairs
of letters closer together or (more rarely) further apart, in order to improve
the appearance of text. Compare, for example, `Yorkshire' (kerned) with
`Y&B;orkshire' (unkerned).
.index "fonts" "metrics"
PMW makes use of the kerning information in fontmetrics files automatically.
This action can be disabled by including the directive &%nokerning%& in the
header of the first movement. If you just want to prevent kerning between a
particular pair of characters, you must insert something between them that has
no noticeable effect, for example, a position movement and its opposite.
.code
"\rm\Y\*u*d\orkshire"
.endd
In this example is the o is not moved nearer to the Y.



.section "Stave 0" SECTstave0
.index "stave zero"
The normal staves of a piece are numbered from 1 to 63. In addition, data for a
special stave, numbered 0, can be supplied. This stave is by default
overprinted on the topmost stave of each system; the &%-s%& stave selection
option on the command line does not affect it. No stave lines, clefs, key
signatures or time signatures are output for stave 0, and any notes that are
specified are treated as `invisible'. However, text items are shown. If the
only stave in a movement is stave 0, the only output is the text items.

The intended use of stave 0 is for setting up text items such as tempo marks
that appear above the topmost stave, whatever combination of staves is
selected. This saves having to input the text items with each part. Dummy notes
can be supplied to ensure that the text items are horizontally aligned where
they are required. A typical example might be as follows (&`/ts`& aligns the
text with the time signature):
.code
[stave 0 text above]
"\bf\Allegro"/ts Q+ | [15]Q! | Q "rit." Q | [23]Q! |
"with feeling" Q+ |
[endstave]
.endd
Overprinting stave zero on the top stave of each system is the default action,
but you can use the &%copyzero%& header directive to have copies of stave zero
duplicated over any number of staves. This directive is followed by a list of
stave numbers, each of which may be optionally followed by a slash and a
dimension. The dimension is a vertical adjustment to the level of stave zero
for the given stave.
.code
copyzero 1 7/10 11/-2
.endd
All the staves over which stave zero is to appear must be specified, including
the top stave. Different versions of &%copyzero%& can be used for different
movements; if not given, its settings are copied from the previous movement. If
a stave over which stave zero is required is suspended, stave zero is output
over the next following non-suspended stave, if there is one. However, if that
stave itself is listed in the &%copyzero%& directive, its spacing parameter is
used. In general, if, as a result of suspension or overprinting, stave zero is
requested more than once at any given level, the spacing parameter for the
highest numbered stave is used. Selection of a subset of staves is equivalent
to the suspension of all others. The default for &%copyzero%& is:
.code
copyzero 1
.endd
This therefore has the desired effect of outputting stave zero over individual
staves that are extracted as parts. If it is necessary to adjust the overall
level for a particular part, constructions such as the following can be used:
.code
*if stave 9
copyzero 9/4
*fi
.endd

There is also a &%[copyzero]%& stave directive, which takes a dimension as an
argument, and adjusts the vertical level of any stave zero material in the
current bar when stave zero is being output at the level of the current stave:
.code
[copyzero 4]
.endd
This example raises the stave zero material in the current bar by 4 points. It
is not necessary for there to be an instance of the &%copyzero%& header
directive specifying the current stave for &%[copyzero]%& to take effect. In
the default case, &%[copyzero]%& takes effect whenever the stave in which it
appears is the top stave of a system.

When first and second time bar marks are specified in stave zero, and there
is a need to adjust their height for certain staves, it should be noted that
the marks are drawn when the bar in which their end point is determined is
processed. Consequently, it is that bar in which &%[copyzero]%& should appear.



.section "Temporarily suspending staves" SECTsuspend
.index "suspending staves"
.index "staves" "suspending"
When a part is silent for a long period of time, it is conventional in full
scores to suppress its stave from the relevant systems. The term `suspended' is
used to describe a stave that is not currently being output. PMW does not
suspend staves automatically, so you have to use the &%[suspend]%& directive in
to tell it when to do so (&R; &<<SUBSECTsuspend>>&). Resumption is automatic
when a non-rest bar is reached, but there is also a &%[resume]%& directive for
forcing it to happen at a particular bar.

Staves can be suspended only if they contain no notes or text items, though
other items such as time and key signature changes may be present. It is
conventional to show all the staves in the first system of a piece, even if
some of them contain only rest bars. However, there is a header directive
called &%suspend%& that makes it possible to suspend individual staves right
from the start (&R; &<<SUBSECTheadsuspend>>&).

When a single stave is being output, suspension normally has no effect, because
multiple rest bars are packed up into a single bar with a count above, and so
systems containing only rest bars do not occur. However if &`S!`& is used for
rest bars instead of &`R!`&, it prevents the amalgamation of adjacent bars and
may lead to potentially suspendable systems, which are undesirable for a single
stave. In this case, therefore, &%[suspend]%& directives are ignored.

.index "empty bars, omitting"
.index "&'ossia'& passages"
Normally, a stave that is not suspended will be output right across the system,
with rest bars as appropriate. However, a stave can be tagged with the
&%omitempty%& option (&R; &<<SUBSECTstave>>&), in which case completely empty
bars generate no output. This can be useful for &'ossia'& passages. A
completely empty bar has no data at all specified for it; a bar containing a
rest is not a completely empty bar.

.chapter "Drawing facilities" CHAPdraw
.index-from I03 "drawing facility"
.index "&%draw%&"
.index "&%[draw]%&"
.index "crop marks"
PMW contains a facility for drawing simple shapes, defined by the user,
positioned relative to notes, bar lines, headings, stave names, or gaps in
slurs and slur-like lines. This makes it possible to create music notation that
is not provided explicitly by PMW. For example, the facility can be used to
draw boxes round notes, vertical brackets between notes, and other unusual
marks above or below the stave. It can be used with headings or footings to
rule lines across the page or to output crop marks.

This chapter is placed here because there are references to the drawing
facilities in what follows. However, unless you plan to make use of these
features, you can safely skip to the next chapter.

A simple programming language is used to describe drawings. Readers unfamiliar
with computer programming may find this chapter hard going and may prefer to
skip it on a first reading. Before describing the facility in detail, we
consider a short example. Suppose there is a requirement to draw a solid black
triangle, with its point upwards, 4 points below the stave. The first thing to
do is to define this shape. This is done using the &%draw%& header directive
as follows:
.code
draw triangle
  3 -4 moveto       @ move to apex
  -3 -6 rlineto     @ line to bottom left
  6 0 rlineto       @ horizontal line to bottom right
  -3 6 rlineto      @ line back to apex
  fill              @ fill it in (solid triangle)
enddraw
.endd
This example of &%draw%& defines a drawing called `triangle'. The lines between
&%draw%& and &%enddraw%& are drawing instructions in a form that is described
below. Whenever the triangle shape is wanted, the stave directive &%[draw
triangle]%& is given before the relevant note.
.code
c'f [draw triangle] g a | c'-b'- [draw triangle] a'-g'- fg |
.endd

.music "music19" 40 4,-14

If many triangles are required, it would be a good idea to use &%*define%& to
set up a macro for &%[draw triangle]%& to save typing. The `language' used to
describe drawings is based on the notion of a &'stack'&. This will be familiar
to you if you have any experience of the computer programming languages Forth
or PostScript. For those readers who are not familiar with stacks, we now
explain how they work.



.section "Stack-based operations"
.index "drawing facility" "stack description"
A stack is a means of storing items of data such that the last item that is
put on the stack is the first item to be taken off it. An analogy is often
drawn with the storage arrangements for trays in self-service restaurants,
where a pile of trays is on a spring-loaded support. Trays are added to the
stack on the top, thereby pushing it down; when a new tray is required, it is
taken from the top of the stack, and the remainder of the trays `pop up'.

PMW's drawing stack contains numbers and references to text strings rather than
trays. (Discussion of strings is postponed till section
&<<SECTtextindrawing>>&.) When PMW is obeying a set of drawing instructions, if
it encounters a number in its input, the number is `pushed' onto the top of the
stack. Consider the following fragment of a drawing program:
.code
3 2 add
.endd
In this example, the first item is the number 3, so the effect of reading it is
to put the stack into this state:

.figure fig01

The second item is also a number, so after it is read, the stack is as follows:

.figure fig02

The third item in this fragment is the word `add'. This is not a number &-- it
is an &'operator'&. The operators used in PMW drawings are based on those found
in the PostScript language. When an operator is encountered, it causes PMW to
perform an operation on the numbers that are already on the stack. In the case
of the &%add%& operator, the two topmost numbers are `popped' off the stack,
added together, and the result is pushed back onto the stack. So in this case,
after `add' has been obeyed, the stack is like this:

.figure fig03

.index "stack underflow"
.index "underflow of stack"
If an operator is encountered that requires more numbers on the stack than
there are present, &'stack underflow'& is said to occur. PMW generates an error
message and abandons the drawing. The stack mechanism is very simple, and
operates quickly. However, it does make it possible to write very obscure code
that is hard to understand. Use PMW's comment facility to help you keep track
of what is going on.

PMW does not clear the drawing stack between one invocation of &%[draw]%& and
the next. This provides one way of passing data between two drawing function
calls, and there is no problem if the related drawing functions are called in
the same bar of the same stave, because they will be always obeyed in the order
in which they appear in the input. However, you must not rely on the order in
which PMW processes bars and staves, other than that bar &'n'& will be
processed before bar &'n'&+1 on any particular stave, but not necessarily
immediately before it (a bar on another stave may intervene). Apart from this,
the order of processing, and therefore the order of obeying &%[draw]%&
directives on several staves, is not defined, and may change between releases
of PMW. Therefore, if you need to pass data between drawing functions in
different bars, and use this facility on more than one stave, the stack cannot
be used safely. &'User variables'& (&R; &<<SECTuservar>>&) must be used
instead.


.section "Drawings with arguments"
Whenever a drawing function is called, either by the &%[draw]%& directive or as
part of some other directive (for example, &%heading%&), its name may be
preceded by a list of numbers or text strings (&R; &<<SECTtextindrawing>>&),
separated by spaces. These are pushed onto the drawing stack immediately before
the function is obeyed, and therefore act as arguments for the function. Here
are some examples:
.code
heading draw 44 logo
[draw 3 -5.6 thing]
[linegap/draw 8.2 blip]
[slurgap/draw "A"/c annotate]
.endd
There is no explicit facility for default values, but these can be provided by
using a macro with arguments to call the drawing function (&R;
&<<SUBSECTmacarg>>&).


.section "Arithmetic operators"
.index "drawing facility" "arithmetic operators"
.index "arithmetic operators for &%draw%&"
The following arithmetic operators are provided for use in drawing
descriptions:
.ilist
&%add%&: Add the two top numbers on the stack, leaving the result on the stack.
.next
&%div%&: Divide the second topmost number on the stack by the number on the top
of the stack, leaving the result on the stack.
.next
&%mul%&: Multiply the two top numbers on the stack, leaving the result on the
stack.
.next
&%neg%&: Negate the topmost number on the stack, leaving the result on the
stack.
.next
&%sub%&: Subtract the topmost number on the stack from the second topmost
number, leaving the result on the stack.
.endlist
Evaluation of the expression ((3+4) &times; 5 + 6)/7 could be coded as
follows:
.code
3 4 add 5 mul 6 add 7 div
.endd


.section "Mathematical function operators"
.index "drawing facility" "mathematical functions"
.index "mathematical functions for &%draw%&"
The following operators make some mathematical functions available in drawing
descriptions:
.ilist
&%cos%&: Replace the top number on the stack, which is interpreted as an angle
in degrees, with the value of its cosine.
.next
&%sin%&: Replace the top number on the stack, which is interpreted as an angle
in degrees, with the value of its sine.
.next
&%sqrt%&: Replace tne top number on the stack with its square root. The number
must not be negative.
.endlist


.section "Truth values"
.index "drawing facility" "true values"
The operators &%false%& and &%true%& push the values 0 and 1 onto the stack,
respectively. These are the same values that are returned by the comparison
operators, and can be tested by the conditional operators.


.section "Comparison operators"
.index "drawing facility" "comparison operators"
.index "comparison operators for &%draw%&"
The following operators operate on the top two values on the stack and leave
their result on the stack. The values must be numbers &-- if they are not, the
result is undefined. Otherwise the result is 1 for &'true'& and 0 for
&'false'&.
.itable none 0 0 2  20 left  300 left
.row &%eq%&  "test equality"
.row &%ne%&  "test inequality"
.row &%ge%&  "test first greater than or equal to second"
.row &%gt%&  "test first greater than second"
.row &%le%&  "test first less than or equal to second"
.row &%lt%&  "test first less than second"
.endtable
For example:
.code
10 10 eq
.endd
leaves the value 1 (&'true'&) on the stack, and
.code
25 4 lt
.endd
yields 0 (&'false'&). The conditional operators can be used to test these
values.


.section "Bitwise and logical operators"
.index "drawing facility" "logical operators"
.index "drawing facility" "bitwise operators"
.index "logical operators for &%draw%&"
.index "bitwise operators for &%draw%&"
The following operators perform bitwise operations on the integer parts of the
top two values on the stack. The result always has a zero fractional part.
.itable none 0 0 2  30 left  300 left
.row &%and%&   "bitwise and"
.row &%or%&    "bitwise or"
.row &%xor%&   "bitwise exclusive or"
.endtable
The &%not%& operator performs bitwise negation on the top number on the stack.
These bitwise operators act as logical operators when applied to the results of
the comparison operators.
.code
5 6 ne 13 7 gt and
.endd
This example leaves 1 (&'true'&) on the stack, because 5 is not equal to 6 and
13 is greater than 7.


.section "Stack manipulation operators"
.index "drawing facility" "stack manipulation"
There are several operators that can be used to manipulate items on
the stack.
.ilist
&%copy%&: Remove the top item, which must be a number, then duplicate the
sequence of that number of items. For example, if the stack contained the
numbers 13, 23, and 53, after &%2 copy%& it would contain 13, 23, 53, 23, 53.
.next
&%dup%&: Duplicate the item on the top of the stack. This has the same effect
as &%copy%& with an argument of 1.
.next
&%exch%&: Exchange the two top items on the stack.
.next
&%pop%&:  Remove the topmost item on the stack, and discard it.
.next
&%roll%&: This operator performs a circular shift of items on the stack. When
it is encountered, there must be three or more items on the stack. The topmost
item on the stack is a count of the number of positions by which items are to
be shifted. The second topmost item is the number of items involved, and there
must be at least this many additional items on the stack. PMW first removes the
two control numbers from the stack. Then it shifts the given number of items by
the given amount. If the amount of shift is positive, each shift consists of
removing an item from the top of the stack, and inserting it below the last
item involved in this operation. This is an `upwards' roll of the stack. If the
amount of shift is negative, each shift consists of removing the lowest item
involved in the operation, and pushing it onto the top of the stack. This is a
`downwards' roll of the stack.
.endlist
Here is an example of the use of &%roll%&.
.code
33 45 67 91 3 1 roll
.endd
When &%roll%& is obeyed, the three items 45, 67, 91 are rolled upwards
one place and the result is:

.figure fig04


.section "Coordinate systems"
.index "drawing facility" "coordinate systems"
.index "drawing facility" "coordinate origin"
The coordinate system used in PMW drawings is a traditional X-Y system, with
all distances specified in points. The initial position of the origin of the
coordinates depends on the item with which the drawing is associated. PMW
drawings can be associated with four kinds of item:

.ilist
A drawing can be associated with a note (or chord) on a stave, or with the end
of a bar if no notes follow the &%[draw]%& directive. The vertical position of
the origin is on the  bottom line of the stave if the stave has 3 or more
lines. For staves with zero, one, or two lines, the vertical position of the
drawing origin is where the bottom line of a 5-line stave would be. The
horizontal position of the origin is either at the left-hand edge of the
associated note, or at the bar line if there is no following note. The
left-hand edge of a note or chord with a downwards pointing stem is the edge of
the stem. This applies even when a chord has some noteheads moved to the other
side of the stem. For breves and semibreves the behaviour is as if there were a
stem. Noteheads are 6 points wide, so the horizontal coordinate of the centre
of a note is 3. That is where the 3s in the triangle example come from.
.next
A drawing can be associated with a heading or footing. The origin of the
coordinate system is at the left-hand side, at the level of the next heading or
footing line. See the &%heading%& directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTheading>>&) for more
details.
.next
A drawing can be associated with a gap in a line that is defined by the
&%[line]%& directive, or with a slur. The origin of the coordinate system is in
the middle of the gap. For details see the &%[linegap]%& (&R;
&<<SUBSECTlinegap>>&) and &%[slurgap]%& (&R; &<<SUBSECTslurgap>>&) directives.
.next
A drawing can be associated with the text the precedes the start of a stave.
The origin of the coordinate system is at the left-hand side, at the level of
the bottom line of the stave. For details, see the &%[stave]%& directive (&R;
&<<SUBSECTstave>>&).
.endlist


.section "Moving the origin"
.index "drawing facility" "moving the origin"
There is an operator called &%translate%& that moves the origin of the
coordinate system to the point specified by the two numbers on the top of the
stack, relative to the old origin.


.section "Graphic operators"
.index "drawing facility" "graphic operators"
.index "graphic operators for &%draw%&"
PMW follows the PostScript/PDF model in the way drawn marks on the page are
specified. There are operators that set up a description of a &'path'& on the
page, and this outline is then either filled in completely, using the &%fill%&
operator, or a line of given thickness is drawn along the path, using the
&%stroke%& operator. A path normally consists of several segments, which may be
lines or curves. There can be gaps in the path. A single path can consist of a
number of disconnected segments.

.index "colour, drawing"
At the start of an external call to a draw function, the current colour is set
to black, the current line width is set to 0.5, and the current setting for
dashed lines is no dashes. However, these values are not changed when a drawing
function is called from within another drawing function (&R;
&<<SECTdrawsub>>&).

A path definition must always start with a &%moveto%& operation, in order to
establish an initial current point. Thereafter, a mixture of moving and drawing
operators may be specified. Distances are, as always, expressed in points. They
are subject to the overall magnification in the same way as other dimensions.
They are not, however, subject to the relative magnification of individual
staves, but there is a variable that contains the magnification of the current
stave (when the drawing is associated with a stave), so that adjustments can be
made explicitly when required.

Whenever a pair of coordinates is required to be on the stack, it is always the
x-coordinate that must be pushed first, and the y-coordinate second. The
graphic operators are as follows:
.ilist
&%currentcolor%&: Push onto the stack the three values of the current colour
setting &-- see &%setcolor%& below (&%currentcolour%& is a synonym).
.next
&%currentdash%&: Push onto the stack the two values of the current dash setting
&-- see &%setdash%& below.
.next
.index "colour, drawing"
&%currentgray%&: Push onto the stack the current value of the grey setting &--
see &%setgray%& below (&%currentgrey%& is a synonym). If the current colour is
not a grey setting (the red, green, and blue values are not all the same), a
grey value is computed using the formula from the NTSC video standard for
converting colour television to black and white, as used by PostScript:
.display
&'gray'& = 0.3 x &'red'& + 0.59 x &'green'& + 0.11 x &'blue'&
.endd
.next
&%currentlinewidth%&: Push onto the stack the current value of the line width
setting &-- see &%setlinewidth%& below.
.next
&%currentpoint%&: Push the coordinates of the current point onto the stack. The
x-coordinate is pushed first.
.next
&%curveto%&: This operator draws a B&eacute;zier curve. There must be six
numbers on the stack when it is called; they are treated as three pairs of
coordinates. The final pair are the end point of the curve, which starts from
the existing current point. The two other pairs of coordinates give the
B&eacute;zier curve control points. If you are not familiar with B&eacute;zier
curves, you will need to discover a bit about them before you can fully
understand this operator. They are described in many books on computer
graphics. Very roughly, the curve starts out from its starting point towards
the first control point, and ends up at the finishing point coming from the
direction of the second control point. The greater the distance of the control
points from the end points, the more the curve goes towards the control points
before turning back to the end point. It does not, however, pass through the
control points.
.next
&%fill%&: This operator causes the interior of the previously defined path to
be completely filled in. The default is to fill in black, but this can be
changed by the &%setgray%& or &%setcolor%& operator. After filling, the path is
deleted, and a new one can then be started.
.next
&%fillretain%&: This command behaves like &%fill%&, except that the path is
retained and can be used again. See &%setgray%& below for an example.
.next
&%lineto%&: The path is extended by a line segment from the current point to
the absolute position given by the two top items on the stack.
.next
&%moveto%&: If there is no current path, this must be the first graphic operator
encountered. It establishes the initial current point. Otherwise, the path is
extended by a move (invisible) segment from the current point to the absolute
position given by the two top items on the stack.
.next
&%rcurveto%&: This operator acts like &%curveto%&, except that the three pairs
of coordinates are taken as relative to the existing current point.
.next
&%rlineto%&: This operator acts like &%lineto%&, except that the coordinates
are taken as relative to the existing current point.
.next
&%rmoveto%&: This operator acts like &%moveto%&, except that the coordinates
are taken as relative to the existing current point.
.next
.index "colour, drawing"
&%setcolor%& or &%setcolour%&: This operator specifies a colour for subsequent
items drawn by &%stroke%& or &%fill%& and also for text that is output by
&%show%&. Three numbers on the stack specify the red, green, and blue
components of the colour. Their values must be between 0 (none) and 1
(maximum). This example sets a shade of purple:
.code
0.5 0.2 1 setcolor
.endd
For shades of grey the three values are identical; see the &%setgray%& operator
below.
.next
&%setdash%&: This operator enables &%stroke%& to draw simple dashed lines.
There must be two numbers on the stack: a dash length and a gap length. For
example,
.code
10 3 setdash
.endd
causes any subsequently drawn lines to consist of dashes of length 10,
interspersed with gaps of length 3.
.next
.index "colour, drawing"
&%setgray%& or &%setgrey%&: This operator is used to specify a grey shade for
drawn items resulting from the use of &%stroke%& or &%fill%&. It has exactly
the same effect as &%setcolor%& with three identical arguments. From release
5.22 a colour or grey setting also applies to text that is output by &%show%&.
A single number between 0 (black) and 1 (white) is taken from the stack. For
example:
.code
0.5 setgray
.endd
Filling a path is analagous to using opaque paint, so &%setgray%& can be used
to fill an area with white and thereby `rub out' any previous marks on the
page. For example, to blank out an area with white and draw a black line round
its edge one could define the path and then use:
.code
1 setgray fillretain 0 setgray stroke
.endd
If you do something like this on a stave of music, you should invoke the
drawing with &%[overdraw]%& rather than &%[draw]%& because that ensures that it
is output after everything else on the stave.
.next
&%setlinewidth%&: A single number is required on the stack to specify the width
of lines to be drawn by the &%stroke%& operator. The default line width is 0.5
points. The value persists from one call of &%[draw]%& to the next.
.next
&%show%&: This operator outputs a text string (&R; &<<SECTtextindrawing>>&).
.next
&%stroke%&: This operator causes a line to be drawn along the previously
defined path, omitting any segments that were defined with &%moveto%& or
&%rmoveto%&. Afterwards, the path is deleted, and a new one can be defined.
.endlist


.section "System variables"
.index "drawing facility" "system variables"
.index "variables for &%draw%&"
In order to set up drawings that are positioned relative to the following note
or chord (for example, to draw a box around it) it is necessary to have access
to some data about it. There are a number of &'system variables'& that provide
this, as well as other variable data values. When encountered in a drawing
description, the name of a variable has the effect of pushing the relevant data
value onto the stack. The system variables that relate to notes should be used
only when the drawing function is called immediately before a note, and those
that relate to staves and systems should not be used in drawings that are
called as headings or footings.
.ilist
&%accleft%&: This variable contains distance from the left-hand edge of the
leftmost notehead to the left-hand edge of the accidental that is furthest to
the left, as a positive number. If there are no accidentals, the value is zero.
.next
&%barnumber%&: When used in a bar, this variable contains the bar number. Note
that if the bar is uncounted, its number includes a decimal fraction (&R;
&<<SECTident>>&). If this variable is used in a drawing that is obeyed at the
start of a system, it contains the number of the first bar in the system. If
used in headings or footings, it contains zero.
.next
&%gaptype%&: This variable contains +1 or -1 when a drawing function is being
obeyed as part of a &%[linegap]%& or &%[slurgap]%& directive; the value is
positive for a line or slur that is above the stave, and negative for one that
is below. Otherwise the variable contains zero.
.next
&%gapx%& and &%gapy%&: When a drawing is being obeyed as part of a
&%[linegap]%& or &%[slurgap]%& directive, these variables contain the
coordinates of the start of the next part of the line or slur. Otherwise they
contain zero.
.next
&%headbottom%&: This variable contains the y-coordinate of the bottom of the
notehead; if the drawing function precedes a chord, this refers to the lowest
notehead.
.next
&%headleft%&: For a chord with a downwards stem in which there is a notehead on
the `wrong' side of the stem, this variable contains the width of this notehead
as a positive number; otherwise its value is zero.
.next
&%headright%&: This variable contains the width of the notehead, except that,
for a chord with an upwards pointing stem in which there is a notehead on the
`wrong' side of the stem, the value is twice the notehead width.
.next
&%headtop%&: This variable contains the y-coordinate of the top of the
notehead; if the drawing function precedes a chord, this refers to the highest
notehead.
.next
&%leftbarx%&: This variable contains the x-coordinate of the previous bar line,
except in the first bar of a system, in which case it is the x-coordinate of a
point slightly to the left of the first note in the bar.
.next
&%linebottom%&: This variable contains the value 2 (scaled to the stave size)
if the bottom of the lowest notehead is on a stave (or ledger) line (that is,
the notehead itself is positioned in a space); otherwise its value is zero.
.next
&%linegapx%& and &%linegapy%&: These variables are old synonyms for &%gapx%&
and &%gapy%&.
.next
&%linelength%&: This variable contains the current line length, as set by the
&%linelength%& header directive, but scaled to the current magnification. For
example, with a magnification of 2 and the default pagelength of 480, the value
in &%linelength%& is 240.
.next
&%linetop%&: This variable contains the value 2 (scaled to the stave size) if
the top of the highest notehead is on a stave (or ledger) line (that is, the
notehead itself is positioned in a space); otherwise its value is zero.
.next
&%magnification%&: This variable contains the value of the overall
magnification. If used on a stave, it does not include the relative
magnification (see &%stavesize%& below).
.next
&%originx%& and &%originy%&: These variables are for use when more than one
note position is participating in a drawing. They contain the &'absolute'&
x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the local coordinate system's origin,
respectively. This makes it possible to leave absolute coordinate values in
user variables or on the stack at the end of a call to &%[draw]%&. A subsequent
&%[draw]%& program can relate these values to its own local coordinate system
by its own use of &%originx%& and/or &%originy%&. An example of this is given
below (&R; &<<SECTexinterdraw>>&).
.next
&%pagelength%&: This variable contains the current page length, as set by the
&%pagelength%& header directive, but scaled to the current magnification. For
example, with a magnification of 2 and the default page length of 720, the
value in &%pagelength%& is 360.
.next
&%pagenumber%&: This variable contains the current page number.
.next
&%stavesize%&: This variable contains the relative magnification for the
current stave, as specified by the &%stavesize%& header directive.
.next
&%stavespace%&: This variable contains the stave spacing for the current stave,
that is, the vertical distance between this stave and the next one.
.next
&%stavestart%&: This variable contains the x-coordinate of the left-hand end of
the current system, relative to the current origin.
.next
&%stembottom%&: This variable contains the y-coordinate of the bottom of the
stem of the note or chord. If there is no stem, or if the stem points upwards,
this is the same value as &%headbottom%&.
.next
&%stemtop%&: This variable contains the y-coordinate of the top of the stem of
the note or chord. If there is no stem, or if the stem points downwards, this
is the same value as &%headtop%&.
.next
&%systemdepth%&: This variable contains the distance from the bottom of the top
stave of the current system to the bottom of the bottom stave.
.next
&%topleft%&: This variable contains the coordinates of the position at which
PMW starts writing on a page, relative to the current origin. When encountered,
it pushes &'two'& values onto the stack. The normal starting position is one
inch down from the top of the paper, and indented according to the sheet width
and line length. This variable can be used with &%translate%& to move the
origin to a fixed point
.index "crop marks"
.index "page" "crop marks"
.index "page" "borders"
.index "borders for pages"
on the page in order to draw such things as crop marks or page borders. The
file &_cropmarks_& in the &_contrib_& directory in the PMW distribution
contains an example.
.endlist



.section "User variables" SECTuservar
.index "drawing facility" "user variables"
.index "user variables in drawings"
.index "variables for &%draw%&"
Up to 20 user variables are available for use in drawing functions. These
variables are &'global'& in that they are shared between all drawing functions.
When you want to pass values from one drawing function call to another, using a
variable is often more convenient than leaving data on the stack. The names of
the variables are chosen by the user, but they must not be the same as any of
the built-in variables or operators. Once a variable has been defined, its
value is retrieved by quoting its name; this causes the value to be copied onto
the stack. To set a value into a variable, the following construction is used:
.display
&`/`&<&'name'&> <&'value'&> &`def`&
.endd
The appearance of &`/`& indicates that the name of the variable is required,
rather than its value. For example, to put the value 10 into a variable called
&`abc`&:
.code
/abc 10 def
.endd
The value that is set in a variable may be changed as often as necessary. A
variable's name must appear in a definition (preceded by a slash) earlier in
the input than its first use as a reference. If a variable is set in one
drawing function and used in another, the definition of the one in which it is
set must come first in the PMW input file. This is not always possible. For
example, when the defining function calls the other function, the called
function must come first. In such cases, a dummy drawing function that is
defined but never obeyed can be used for the sole purpose of defining user
variable names.



.section "Text strings in drawings" SECTtextindrawing
.index "drawing facility" "text strings"
Text strings can be output from within drawing functions. The appearance of a
string in quotes inside a drawing definition or as an argument to a drawing
function causes an item representing the string to be pushed onto the stack.
Such an item can be copied or moved around the stack in the normal way, but can
be processed only by special string operators. The most important of these is
the &%show%& operator, which causes the string to be output at the current
point:
.code
draw string
  0 -12 moveto "text" show
enddraw
.endd
The default font is roman, but the string may contain font changes and other
escape sequences, just like any other string. It may be followed by one or more
of the following options:

.itable none 0 0 2  60 left  300 left
.row &`/box`&         "enclose the string in a rectangular box"
.row &`/c`&           "centre the string at the current point"
.row &`/d`&<&'n'&>    "move the string down by <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/e`&           "align the end of the string with the current point"
.row &`/l`&<&'n'&>    "move the string left by <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/r`&<&'n'&>    "move the string right by <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/ring`&        "enclose the string in a ring (circular if a short string)"
.row &`/rot`&<&'n'&>  "rotate the string by <&'n'&> degrees (&R; &<<SECTtextitems>>&)"
.row &`/s`&<&'n'&>    "output the string at settable size <&'n'&> (&R; &<<SUBSECTtextsizes>>&)"
.row &`/S`&<&'n'&>    "output the string at fixed size <&'n'&> (&R; &<<SUBSECTtextsizes>>&)"
.row &`/u`&<&'n'&>    "move the string up by <&'n'&> points"
.endtable

The &`/u`&, &`/d`&, &`/l`&, and &`/r`& options are not particularly useful on
strings that are part of drawing definitions, because you can position such
strings with &%moveto%& or &%rmoveto%&. However, when a string is an argument
to a drawing it is sometimes helpful to be able to modify the position that is
defined within the drawing. These moving options are ignored when the string is
used by some operator other than &%show%& (for example, &%stringwidth%&).

When the string is centred or end-aligned, outputting the string does not
change the current point; in the default, left-aligned case, the current point
is moved to the end of the string. A path may be begun before outputting a
string and continued afterwards. As an example of the use of the text facility,
consider music in the sixteenth and seventeenth century style where, instead of
using ties that cross bar lines, augmentation dots without notes are placed on
the far side of the bar lines.
.code
draw dot
  0 headbottom 2 linebottom sub add moveto "\mf\?" show
enddraw
*define bd() [notes off draw dot] &&1-; [notes on]
time 2/4
[stave 1 treble 1]
ra | &bd(a) b-g |
.endd

.music "music34" 32 8,-18

In this example, the macro &%bd%& (`bar dot') is defined, in order to shorten
the input for each dot. Its argument is the note pitch for which a dot is
required. The `tied' note is not actually shown because of the use of &%[notes
off]%& but its pitch is available to the drawing function, which uses it to
put a dot character from the music font at the appropriate level on the stave
(a question mark in the music font corresponds to the horizontal dot
character). The input could be shortened even further by including the previous
note and the bar line inside the macro expansion.



.section "String operators"
.index "drawing facility" "string operators"
As well as &%show%&, there are three other operators that act on strings.
.ilist
The &%cvs%& operator converts a number to a string, typically so that it can be
output. There must be two arguments on the stack: the number to be converted,
and a string that provides a place to store the converted number. The string
may be empty, in which case the roman font is used; if not, the font is taken
from the first character in the string. The string may be followed by any of
the usual string options. When &%cvs%& is obeyed, the two arguments are removed
from the stack and a string containing a representation of the number is pushed
back. For example, to output the current bar number at text size 2, centred at
the current position:
.code
barnumber ""/c/s2 cvs show
.endd
.next
.index "drawing facility" "string width"
The &%stringwidth%& operator replaces a string on the stack with the horizontal
and vertical distances by which the current point would move if the string were
output. Note that the second value is &'not'& the height of the string, and in
most cases is zero. There is an example of the use of &%stringwidth%& in the
section on looping operators below (&R; &<<SECTloopop>>&).
.next
.index "drawing facility" "font size"
The &%fontsize%& operator replaces a string on the stack with the font size
associated with it.
.endlist



.section "Drawing subroutines"  SECTdrawsub
.index "drawing facility" "subroutines"
One drawing can be called as a subroutine from within another by means of the
&%draw%& operator. The caller and the called drawing both see the same drawing
stack and graphics state (current position, current path, line width, colour,
etc). Changes made by the subroutine can therefore affect the caller. The
behaviour is as if the &%draw%& operation is replaced by the text of the
subroutine. For example, to draw two crosses below the stave on either side of
a note's position:
.code
draw cross
  -4  0 rmoveto 8 0 rlineto
  -4 -4 rmoveto 0 8 rlineto
  stroke
enddraw
draw crosses
   -4 -6 moveto draw cross
   10 -6 moveto draw cross
enddraw
[stave 1 treble 1] [draw crosses] gabc' |
.endd

.music "music35" 32 4,-16

The subroutine must be defined before the definition of any drawings in which
it is called. Subroutines cannot be called recursively, that is, a drawing
cannot call itself, and a multi-drawing recursive loop is not possible because
a drawing must be defined before it is called.


.section "Blocks"
.index "drawing facility" "blocks"
A &'block'& is a portion of a drawing's coding enclosed in curly brackets. It
is used by the conditional and looping operators. When a block is encountered
during drawing, its contents are not obeyed immediately. Instead, a reference
to them is placed on the stack, for use by a subsequent operator. Blocks can be
nested inside each other.


.section "Conditional operators"
.index "drawing facility" "conditional operators"
The operator &%if%& is used to obey a portion of the drawing conditionally. It
uses the top two items on the stack. The first must be a number, and the second
a reference to a block. Both are removed from the stack, and if the value of
the number is zero, nothing else happens. Otherwise, the contents of the block
are obeyed. For example, to output the bar number if it is greater than 5:
.code
barnumber 5 gt { barnumber "" cvs show } if
.endd
The bar number and the number 5 are pushed onto the stack; the comparison
operator &%gt%& replaces them with 1 if the bar number is greater than 5, or 0
otherwise. Then a reference to the block is pushed onto the stack, and the
&%if%& operator causes it to be obeyed if the number is non-zero. The
&%ifelse%& operator is similar to &%if%&, except that it requires two blocks on
the stack. The first is obeyed if the condition is true, the second if it is
false.



.section "Looping operators" SECTloopop
.index "drawing facility" "looping operators"
The &%repeat%& operator expects a number and a block on the stack. It removes
them, and then obeys the block that number of times. If the number has a
fractional part, it is ignored. For example, to output a row of asterisks from
the start of the bar to just before the current note or bar line, the following
function could be used (adding 0.5 ensures that the count is rounded to the
nearest integer):
.code
draw astline
  leftbarx -15 moveto
  leftbarx neg "*" stringwidth pop div
  0.5 add { "*" show } repeat
enddraw
[stave 1 bass 0] gddg | de [draw astline] fg |
.endd

.music "music36" 36 4,-14

The &%loop%& operator expects only a block on the stack, and it obeys it
repeatedly until the &%exit%& operator is encountered. To guard against
accidents, a limit of 1,000 times round the loop is imposed. Another way of
showing these asterisks is:
.code
draw astline
  leftbarx -15 moveto
  { "*" show currentpoint pop 0 ge {exit} if } loop
enddraw
.endd
The &%exit%& operator can also be used to stop a &%repeat%& loop prematurely.
If encountered outside a loop, it causes an exit from the current drawing
function.



.section "Drawing in headings and footings"
Drawing functions can be obeyed in headings and footings. For example, crop
marks, horizontal rules, and borders on title pages can be drawn by this
method. For details, see the description of the &%heading%& directive (&R;
&<<SUBSECTheading>>&).


.section "Drawing at stave starts"
Drawing functions can be obeyed at the start of a stave, as well as, or instead
of text. For details see the description of the &%[stave]%& directive (&R;
&<<SUBSECTstave>>&).



.section "Testing drawing code"
.index "drawing facility" "testing"
.index "testing &%draw%& code"
When a drawing does not turn out the way you expect it to, it can sometimes be
difficult to track down exactly what is wrong. Being able to examine the
contents of the stack at particular points is sometimes helpful. The operator
&%pstack%& causes the contents of the stack to be written to the standard error
stream.


.section "Example of use of system variables"
.index "drawing facility" "examples"
This example illustrates the use of the variables that contain the dimensions
of the note that follows the &%[draw]%& directive:
.code flow
draw box
  -2 headleft sub accleft sub stembottom 1.3 sub moveto
  stemtop stembottom sub 2.6 add dup 0 exch rlineto
  headleft headright add accleft add 4 add dup 0 rlineto exch
  0 exch neg rlineto
  neg 0 rlineto
  stroke
enddraw

draw bracket
  -2 headleft sub accleft sub headbottom linebottom add moveto
  -2 0 rlineto
  -4 headleft sub accleft sub headtop linetop sub lineto
   2 0 rlineto
   stroke
enddraw

[stave 1 treble 1]
[draw box] $a [draw box] f' [draw box] (fg)
[space 10] [draw box] (f'g')
[space 6] [draw bracket] (#fc') [draw bracket] (g#d')
[endstave]
.endd

.music "music20" 40 4,-12

The definitions look a bit daunting at first sight, but are not difficult to
understand when broken down into their constituent parts. If you find the
explanation hard to follow, try using pencil and paper to keep track of the
values as they are pushed onto and popped off the stack.

We consider first the `box' drawing, which encloses the following note or chord
in a rectangular box. The first line establishes the start of the drawing path
at the bottom left-hand corner of the box:
.code
-2 headleft sub accleft sub stembottom 1.3 sub moveto
.endd
It starts by pushing the value -2 onto the stack, then subtracting from it the
&%headleft%& and &%accleft%& variables. This gives a value for the x-coordinate
that is two points to the left of the leftmost accidental, taking into account
any notehead that is positioned to the left of the stem. The y-coordinate is
computed as the value of the &%stembottom%& variable less 1.3 points. The
&%moveto%& operator then establishes the start of the drawing path, using the
two coordinate values that are on the stack, and leaving the stack empty.
.code
stemtop stembottom sub 2.6 add dup 0 exch rlineto
.endd
The second line of the drawing instructions computes the length of the vertical
sides of the rectangle. It does this by subtracting the value of &%stembottom%&
from the value of &%stemtop%& and then adding 2.6 to the result. This is to
allow 1.3 points of clear space at the top and the bottom. As this value is
going to be needed twice, once for each side, the &%dup%& operator is called to
duplicate it. To draw the left-hand vertical, a relative x-coordinate of zero
is pushed on the stack, and then &%exch%& is used to get the coordinates in the
correct order on the stack before calling &%rlineto%&. The current point is now
at the top left-hand corner of the rectangle, and the stack contains the
duplicated value of the vertical sides' length.
.code
headleft headright add accleft add 4 add dup 0 rlineto exch
.endd
The third line does a computation for the rectangle's width, which is the sum
of the contents of the &%headleft%&, &%headright%&, and &%accleft%& variables,
plus four (allowing two points clear on either side). Once again, &%dup%& is
used to leave a copy of the value on the stack, and this time a zero relative
y-coordinate is used, in order to draw a horizontal line. The two remembered
lengths that are left on the stack are now exchanged, so that the vertical
length becomes the topmost value.
.code
0 exch neg rlineto
neg 0 rlineto
stroke
.endd
The remaining lines use these stacked values to complete the rectangle. The
first line pushes a zero relative x-coordinate, ensures that the order on the
stack is correct by means of &%exch%& (bringing the vertical side length to the
top), and negates the y-coordinate so that the line is drawn downwards.
The second line negates the one remaining value on the stack, which is the
width of the rectangle, pushes a zero relative y-coordinate, and draws the
final horizontal line to the left. Finally, &%stroke%& causes a line to be
drawn along the path which has just been defined.

The `bracket' drawing draws a left-hand bracket whose size is adjusted for the
notes of a chord, and which also takes into account the position of the
noteheads on stave lines or in spaces.
.code
-2 headleft sub accleft sub headbottom linebottom add moveto
-2 0 rlineto
-4 headleft sub accleft sub headtop linetop sub lineto
 2 0 rlineto
 stroke
.endd
The first line computes the position of the start of the path, which is the
right-hand end of the bottom `jog'. The x-coordinate is 2 points to the left of
the left-most accidental, and the y-coordinate is the bottom of the lowest
notehead if this position is not on a stave line (in which case &%linebottom%&
is zero) or two points above if it is. The second line draws the lower
horizontal `jog' to the left as a relative line. The third line computes the
absolute coordinates of the top left-hand corner, taking into account whether
the top notehead is on a line or not. An alternative to this would have been to
save the initial x-coordinate on the stack instead of recomputing it from
scratch. Finally, the top `jog' is drawn to the right, and the path is stroked.


.section "Example of inter-note drawing" SECTexinterdraw
This example illustrates the use of the &%originx%& variable for connecting up
two different notes:
.code
draw save
  headbottom originx
enddraw

draw connect
  originx sub 3 add dup 3 add 2 div
  3 1 roll exch 2 sub moveto
  -12 lineto
  3 headbottom 2 sub lineto
  stroke
enddraw

[stave 1 treble 1]
b [draw save] e c'-g-a-b- [draw connect] a g |
[endstave]
.endd

.music "music21" 40 4,-12

The `save' drawing does not actually do any drawing at all. It just saves on
the stack the y-coordinate of the bottom of the next note, and the absolute
x-coordinate of its left-hand edge. Using the stack to pass data between two
drawing functions is a simple method that works well when both functions are
called in the same bar on the same stave. An alternative method is to use user
variables (&R; &<<SECTuservar>>&); this must be used if the drawing
functions appear on several different staves and the related functions are not
called in the same bar.

The first thing the `connect' drawing program does is to push &'its'& x-origin
onto the stack, and subtract it from the saved value. The result of this
computation is the x-coordinate of the first note (the one immediately
following &%[draw save]%&), relative to the current local coordinate system,
which is, of course, based on the note following &%[draw connect]%&. A value of
3 is added to this, giving the horizontal position of the middle of the first
note. The &%dup%& operator saves a copy of this value on the stack for later
use, and another 3 is added to the top value, giving the coordinate of the
right-hand edge of the first note.

The next bit of computation finds the mid-point between the two notes. The
left-hand edge of the second note has an x-coordinate of zero in the local
coordinate system, so dividing the coordinate of the right-hand edge of the
first note by 2 gives us the mid-point. There are now three values on the
stack:
.display rm
the x-coordinate of the halfway point
the x-coordinate of the mid-point of the first note
the y-coordinate of the bottom of the first note
.endd
The operation &%3 1 roll%& changes this to:
.display rm
the x-coordinate of the mid-point of the first note
the y-coordinate of the bottom of the first note
the x-coordinate of the halfway point
.endd
The subsequent &%exch%& changes it to:
.display rm
the y-coordinate of the bottom of the first note
the x-coordinate of the mid-point of the first note
the x-coordinate of the halfway point
.endd
A value of 2 is subtracted from the y-coordinate of the first note, and the
&%moveto%& operator is called to start the drawing path, which therefore begins
two points below the first note, and halfway along its notehead. Now only the
x-coordinate of the halfway point between the two notes remains on the stack.
The operation &%-12 lineto%& draws a line from the initial position to the
halfway point, twelve points below the bottom of the stave. The stack is now
empty. The final lines of the drawing program continue the path to a position
two points below the end note at the mid-point of its notehead, and then
cause it to be stroked.

.tocsubsectoff
.chapter "Header directives" CHAPheaddir
.index-from I04 "directives" "header"
.index-from I05 "header" "directives"
A header section in a PMW file contains &'header directives'&. Each starts
with a keyword, and sometimes the keyword is followed by numerical or other
data. The case of letters in keywords is not significant. It is usual to start
a new line for each header directive, but this is not a requirement. A header
section is terminated by an opening square bracket character that is not in a
text string or in a comment (following an @). None of the header information is
mandatory because there are default values for all the parameters; a header
section may be completely empty.

Most of the header directives may appear at the start of a new movement as
well as at the start of the input, but a few may only appear at the very start
of the file, that is, only in the first movement (&R; &<<SUBSECTmovement>>&).
In general, header directives may appear in any order, but there are some
fairly obvious cases where the order matters. For example, a multiplicative
change to the note spacing must follow a setting of absolute values, the
definition of a drawing or macro must precede its use, and a stave selection
must precede any tests based on which staves are selected.



.section "Alphabetical list of header directives"
.index "number lists"
The header directives are now described in alphabetical order. Several of them
take a list of numbers as data. In all cases, such numbers can be separated by
commas and/or spaces, but the whole list must all be on one line. The values
set by most directives persist from movement to movement. When this is not the
case, it is noted in the description.


.subsection "Accadjusts"
.index "&%accadjusts%&"
.index "accidentals" "spacing"
.index "spacing" "accidentals"
Accidentals are normally placed about four points to the left of the notes to
which they apply (the exact distance depends on the accidental). The
&%accadjusts%& directive can be used to vary this positioning, on a note-type
basis. It does not affect the spacing of the notes themselves; it just moves
the accidentals right or left. The directive is followed by up to eight
numbers, which apply to each of the eight note types, starting with breves. The
numbers can be positive (move to the right, that is, nearer the note) or
negative (move to the left, that is, further from the note).
.code
accadjusts 1.8
.endd
This example has the effect of moving any accidental that precedes a breve 1.8
points to the right.



.subsection "Accspacing"
.index "&%accspacing%&"
.index "accidentals" "spacing"
The &%accspacing%& directive must be followed by at least five numbers. They
set the widths that are used for accidentals in time signatures and when
outputting notes, in the order double sharp, flat, double flat, natural, and
sharp. The default values are:
.code
accspacing 5.25 4.5 8.0 4.25 5.0
.endd
The values for sharp and flat also apply to half flats and half sharps in style
1 (&R; &<<SUBSECThalfaccs>>&). The value for the narrower style 0 half sharps
is by default set to the sharp value minus 0.2, but this can be overridden by
supplying a sixth value.

The default widths are not the same as the widths that are set in the PMW music
font, where the values are better suited for including the characters in text.
It should not be necessary to change these widths unless a non-standard music
font is being used.



.subsection "B2PFfont" SUBSECTb2pffont
.index "&%b2pffont%&"
.index "B2PF text processing"
This directive is permitted only in the first movement. B2PF is a library for
transforming strings of basic Unicode characters into their `presentation
forms', where the displayed letter shapes may vary, depending on their
surroundings. PMW can optionally be compiled to make use of the B2PF library.
This makes available the &%b2pffont%& directive, which has the following form:
.display
&`b2pffont`& <&'fontword'&> <&'options'&> "<&'B2PF rules file'&>"
.endd
The first argument must be one of the words `roman', `italic', `bold',
`bolditalic', `symbol', or `extra' followed by a number in the range 1&--12,
specifying which text font is being configured. Most commonly it will be one of
the extra fonts. Any number of B2PF options may then follow, followed by one or
more B2PF rules file names in quotes. If just one empty string is given, B2PF
processing is initialized without any defined rules. This could be used to
reverse the code points in a string.

The rules files are first sought in directories listed in the &%-F%& command
line option, followed by B2PF's default directory. Here are some examples:
.code
B2PFfont extra 1 "Arabic" "Arabic-LigExtra"
B2PFfont extra 2 input_backchars output_backchars "Arabic"
.endd
The options specify whether the input and output strings are in reading order
or reverse reading order. The available options are &`input_backchars`&,
&`input_backcodes`&, &`output_backchars`& and &`output_backcodes`&. See the
B2PF documentation for more details.



.subsection "Bar"
.index "&%bar%&"
.index "bar numbers" "starting value"
.index "movement" "continuing bar numbers"
This directive must be followed by a number; it causes the numbering of bars to
begin from a number other than one. This facility is useful for fragments of
pieces, or continuing a bar number sequence through several movements.



.subsection "Barlinesize"
.index "&%barlinesize%&"
.index "bar lines" "for different sized staves"
When a system contains staves of differing sizes (as set by &%stavesizes%&) it
is usually the case that bar lines are split where the stave size changes, so
the use of barlines of differing thicknesses for the different staves looks
reasonable. To cope with the rare case when barlines must cover staves of
different sizes, the &%barlinesize%& directive exists, because PMW cannot
decide for itself what the size should be &-- the default use of different
sizes leads to jagged joins. &%Barlinesize%& must be followed by a single
number, which specifies the relative size of bar line to be used throughout. A
value of zero requests the default action of using different sizes.
.code
barlinesize 1
.endd
This example requests that full size barlines be used throughout; they will
look somewhat fat on any staves whose size is less than 1, and thin on any
whose size is greater than 1.



.subsection "Barlinespace"
.index "&%barlinespace%&"
.index "bar lines" "space after"
.index "bar lines" "invisible, no space after"
.index "invisible items" "bar lines, space after"
.index "spacing" "bar lines"
This directive gives control over the amount of space left after bar lines. It
must be followed by a single dimension, which may be preceded by a plus or a
minus sign, indicating a change to the existing value. If neither of these is
present, the number specifies an absolute value. The default value can be reset
in a subsequent movement by following the directive with an asterisk instead of
a number. The default is related to the space following a minim, with a minimum
of 3 points. However, if an explicit space is specified, no minimum is
enforced. A value of zero may be given &-- this is useful for a piece with no
bar lines, where `invisible bar lines' can be used to tell PMW where systems
can be ended, but no space must be inserted.



.subsection "Barlinestyle" SUBSECTbarlinestyle
.index "&%barlinestyle%&"
.index "bar lines" "style"
.index "bar lines" "dashed"
.index "bar lines" "between staves only"
This directive specifies the way in which bar lines are to appear on all
staves. It takes a numerical argument, with a value in the range 0&--5. There
is also a &%[barlinestyle]%& stave directive that sets the style separately for
an individual stave. The styles are as follows:
.ilist
Style 0 is the normal style, using solid bar lines.
.next
Style 1 specifies dashed bar lines.
.next
Styles 2 and 3 cause solid or dashed bar lines (respectively) to be drawn
&'between'& staves only; if the bar line is broken at a stave where either of
these styles applies, nothing at all is output. These styles work only when
the stave spacing is 32 points or greater (which is normally the case).
.next
Style 4 specifies a half-height bar line in the middle of the stave. It implies a
bar line break at any stave where it is used.
.next
Style 5 causes two very short stub lines to be drawn, above and below the
stave. It implies a bar line break at any stave where it is used.
.endlist
Specifying a double bar by inputting &`||`& overrides the stave or movement
bar line style, which can also be overridden by inputting a digit immediately
after the vertical bar character, to force a particular style. The following
example shows the six available styles:

.music "music33" 64 0,-20 centre

Note that the &%breakbarlines%& directive can be used to specify breaks in all
bar lines at particular staves when style 0 or 1 is used, and an individual bar
line can be broken by using &%[breakbarline]%&.



.subsection "Barnumberlevel"
.index "&%barnumberlevel%&"
.index "bar numbers" "level adjustment"
This directive adjusts the level of bar numbers. It must be followed by a plus
or a minus sign and a dimension.
.code
barnumberlevel +4
.endd
This example puts all bar numbers four points higher up the page than they
would otherwise have been. The default level is calculated using the size of
the top stave of the system (excluding stave 0), but the adjustment value set
by this directive is not scaled.



.subsection "Barnumbers" SUBSECTheadbarno
.index "&%barnumbers%&"
.index "bar numbers" "requesting"
.index "numbering bars"
This directive specifies that bars are to be automatically numbered. &*Note*&:
An incomplete bar at the start of a movement is counted for the purpose of bar
numbering, unless it contains &%[nocount]%& (see section
&<<SUBSECTbarcounting>>& for an example). The &%barnumbers%& directive
completely ignores any bars that contain &%[nocount]%&. Automatic bar numbering
can be overridden for individual bars, and uncounted bars may be numbered, by
means of the stave directive &%[barnumber]%& (&R; &<<SUBSECTstavebarno>>&).
Several different automatic numbering options are available, the general form
of &%barnumbers%& being as follows:
.display
&`barnumbers`& <&'enclosure'&> <&'interval'&> <&'fontsize'&> <&'fontname'&>
.endd
The first argument, which is optional, must be one of the words `boxed',
`roundboxed', or `ringed'. These specify that bar numbers are to appear inside
rectangular boxes (with either mitred or round corners), or roughly circular
rings. If none of these words are given, the numbers appear without any special
identification. The second argument must be present, and is either the word
`line' or a number. If `line' is given, a bar number is output over the first
bar of every line of music except the first line of each movement. If a number
is given, it specifies the interval between bar numbers.
.code
barnumbers boxed 10
.endd
This example requests a bar number, enclosed in a box, every 10
bars. The third argument is optional; it specifies the size of the font. The
default size is 10 points.
.code
barnumbers line 8.5
.endd
This example numbers the bars at the start of each system, using a font of size
8.5 points. The final argument, which is optional, specifies the font
(typeface). The default is roman.
.code
barnumbers 5 9/1.1 italic
.endd
This example requests bar numbers every 5 bars in a 9-point italic font,
horizontally stretched by 1.1.


.subsection "Beamendrests"
.index "&%beamendrests%&"
This directive, which has no arguments, causes PMW to include rests that are
adjacent to beamed groups within the beams (&R; &<<SECTbeamendrests>>&).



.subsection "Beamflaglength"
.index "&%beamflaglength%&"
The length of short, straight note flags that are used with beams (for example,
for a semiquaver beamed to a dotted quaver) can be set by this directive. The
default is 5 points; it scales with the relative stave magnification.



.subsection "Beamthickness"
.index "&%beamthickness%&"
.index "thickness of beams"
This directive takes a single dimension as its argument; it sets the thickness
of the lines drawn for beaming notes together. The default thickness is 1.8
points. On some printers and at some magnifications a better effect can be
obtained by changing the thickness (normally by making it smaller). The
thickness should not be set greater than 2.5 points.



.subsection "Bottommargin and topmargin" SUBSECTbottommargin
.index "&%bottommargin%&"
.index "&%topmargin%&"
.index "space" "at page top"
.index "space" "at page bottom"
The &%bottommargin%& and &%topmargin%& directives make it possible to reserve
white space at the top or bottom of a page, within the overall page length,
provided that there is room to do this after the systems have been fitted onto
the page. These directives give some additional control over the vertical
justification action described in section &<<SUBSECTjustify>>&, once the
pagination of a piece is determined. In each case, a single dimension is
required.
.code
topmargin 20
bottommargin 5
.endd
The values can be changed for an individual page by means of the
&%[topmargin]%& and &%[bottommargin]%& directives. The default values for the
margins are zero for the bottom margin and 10 points for the top margin. The
use made of these values depends on the vertical justification mode for the
page. The phrase `the contents of the page' below excludes any text that is
defined as a footing or as a page heading, but includes start-of-movement
headings.
.ilist
If the justify mode is `top' only, the contents of the page are moved down by
the top margin, provided there is enough room on the page to do this. If not,
the contents of the page are moved down as far as possible. The bottom margin
value is ignored.
.next
If the justify mode is `bottom' only, the contents of the page are moved up by
the bottom margin, provided there is enough room on the page to do this. If
not, the contents of the page are moved up as far as possible. The top margin
value is ignored.
.next
If the justify mode is both `top' and `bottom', the amount of space available
for spreading the systems vertically is decreased by the sum of the top margin
and the bottom margin, and the contents of the page are moved down by the top
margin, provided there is enough spreading space available. If there is
insufficient spreading space, it is divided &'pro rata'& between the top margin
and the bottom margin, the systems are not spread at all, and the contents of
the page are moved down by the adjusted top margin value.
.next
If the justify mode is neither `top' nor `bottom', both values are ignored.
.endlist
The effect of using these directives is to allow more of the page to be used
when necessary, but to keep the systems nearer the centre of the page when
there is a lot of space left over.



.subsection "Brace and Bracket"
.index "&%bracket%&"
.index "&%brace%&"
.index "joining signs"
.index "staves" "joining signs"
These two directives specify which staves are to be joined by brackets and/or
braces. A bracket is traditionally used for groups of independent instruments
or voices, whereas a brace is reserved for pairs of staves that apply to a
single instrument, frequently a keyboard. (See also the &%thinbracket%&
directive, which specifies another kind of bracket.) Each of these directives
must be followed by a list of pairs of stave numbers, the members of each pair
being separated by a minus sign, with the pairs themselves separated by spaces
and/or commas.
.code
bracket 1-4,5-7
brace 8-9
.endd
This example specifies that staves 1&--4 and 5&--7 are to be joined by
brackets, and staves 8 and 9 are to be joined by a brace. In addition to these
marks, the entire system is by default joined by a single vertical line at the
left-hand side. (See the &%join%& and &%joindotted%& directives for ways of
changing this.) The default action of PMW is to join all the staves with a
single bracket. If no brackets of any kind are required, it is necessary to
suppress this by including a &%bracket%& directive with no following list.

If only a single stave is selected, for example, when a part is being extracted
from a full score, these directives are ignored; no marks precede the clef on a
single stave in this case. Occasionally a bracket is required for a single
stave within a system; this may be specified by giving just one stave number.
The effect can also occur if all but one of a bracketed group of staves is
suspended. By contrast, a brace is never output for just one stave.



.subsection "Bracestyle"
.index "&%bracestyle%&"
.index "shape of brace"
.index "brace, shape of"
The default brace shape curves a lot at the ends and almost touches the staves.
An alternate form that does not curve so much at the ends can be selected by
specifying &%bracestyle 1%&. The default can be reset in a subsequent movement
by &%bracestyle 0%&.


.subsection "Breakbarlines"
.index "&%breakbarlines%&"
.index "bar lines" "breaking"
By default, PMW draws bar lines through all the staves of a system without a
break. The &%breakbarlines%& directive specifies the staves after which there
is to be a break in the bar lines. It is followed by a list of stave numbers.
.code
breakbarlines 3 6 8
.endd
This example specifies that there is to be a vertical break in the bar lines
after staves 3, 6 and 8. Two numbers separated by a minus sign can be used to
specify breaks for a sequence of staves:
.code
breakbarlines 1-4
.endd
&%Breakbarlines%& can also appear with no numbers after it at all; in this case
there is a break after every stave. If &%breakbarlines%& is specified at the
start of a new movement, it must list all the staves at which a break is
required. If it is not given, breaks carry over from the previous movement. The
stave directives &%[breakbarline]%& and &%[unbreakbarline]%& can be used to
override the setting for individual barlines on a given stave.



.subsection "Breakbarlinesx"
.index "&%breakbarlinesx%&"
.index "bar lines" "breaking"
The &%breakbarlinesx%& directive acts exactly as &%breakbarlines%&, except that
the final bar line of each system is &'not'& broken, but is drawn solid right
through the system.



.subsection "Breveledgerextra"
.index "&%breveledgerextra%&"
.index "breve" "extra ledger length"
.index "ledger lines" "extra length for breve"
This directive specifies the number of points of extra length that ledger lines
for breves have at either end. The default value is 2.3.


.subsection "Breverests"
.index "&%breverests%&"
.index "whole bar rests"
.index "rests" "whole bar"
.index "breve" "rest"
By default, PMW uses a semibreve rest sign for a complete bar's rest, whatever
the time signature. This header directive changes its behaviour so that the
notation used for a whole bar rest depends on the number of crotchets in the
bar.
.ilist
If there are 8 crotchets (4/2 or 2/1 or 2*C etc.), a breve rest sign is used.
.next
If there are 12 crotchets (6/2 or 12/4 or 2*3/2 etc.), a dotted breve rest sign
is used.
.next
If there are 6 crotchets (3/2 or 2*3/4 etc.), a dotted semibreve rest sign is
used.
.next
Otherwise a semibreve rest is used.
.endlist



.subsection "Caesurastyle"
.index "&%caesurastyle%&"
The default caesura `character' is two slanting lines through the top line of
the stave. This directive specifies an alternative, single line, style if it is
followed by the number 1. The default can be reset in a subsequent movement by
specifying 0.



.subsection "Check"
.index "&%check%&"
This directive, which has no arguments, can be used to override an occurrence
of &%nocheck%& in a previous movement.



.subsection "Checkdoublebars"
.index "&%checkdoublebars%&"
This directive, which has no arguments, can be used to override an occurrence
of &%nocheckdoublebars%& in a previous movement.



.subsection "Clefsize"
.index "&%clefsize%&"
.index "size" "of clefs"
.index "clefs" "size"
By default, new clefs that appear in the middle of lines of music are shown
at the same size as clefs at the left-hand side. This directive is used to
specify a different relative size for such clefs.
.code
Clefsize 0.7
.endd
This example specifies that intermediate clefs are to be 0.7 times the normal
size.



.subsection "Clefstyle" SUBSECTclefstyle
.index "&%clefstyle%&"
.index "style of clef"
.index "clefs" "style of"
.index "clefs" "old-fashioned"
Some early editions use &-[&{{zzz&#174;}}&]-& for F-clefs and &{{&#175;}}& for
C-clefs. The &%clefstyle%& directive makes it possible to reproduce this usage.
It takes a single numerical argument, with the following values:

.itable none 0 0 2  16 left  200 left
.row &`0`& "all modern clefs"
.row &`1`& "old-fashioned F clefs"
.row &`2`& "old-fashioned C clefs"
.row &`3`& "old-fashioned F and C clefs"
.endtable

The &-[&{{zzz&#174;}}&]-& graphic is wider than the modern &-[&{{"}}&]-& shape.
The layout of clefs is arranged so that two dots appear in the same place in
both cases. This means that the old-fashioned clef extends further to the left
than the modern one, and with PMW's default settings, it runs into stave
joining lines and brackets. Therefore, when using old-fashioned F clefs, the
&%startlinespacing%& directive should be used to insert at least 2 points of
space before the clefs.



.subsection "Clefwidths"
.index "&%clefwidths%&"
.index "key signatures" "alignment"
When it is laying out a system, PMW inspects the clefs of all the staves, and
positions the key signature immediately to the right of the widest clef. When
the clefs change between systems, it can happen that all the key signatures on
a page do not line up vertically, a feature that is sometimes required.
Unfortunately, it is not easy to arrange for PMW to do this automatically,
because it does the layout in a single pass through the input, and so does not
know what clef arrangements lie ahead. However, the &%clefwidths%& directive is
provided to enable this to be done manually. &%Clefwidths%& specifies the
widths to be used for each type of clef when computing where to put key
signatures. The directive is followed by up to five numbers, which specify the
widths of the G-clef, F-clef, C-clef, H-clef, and no clef, respectively. The
default settings are:
.code
clefwidths 13 16 15 15 0
.endd
The values given may include fractions. In a piece which has treble and bass
clefs in some systems and only treble clefs in others, a setting such as
.code
clefwidths 16 16
.endd
would ensure that all the key signatures line up.



.subsection "Codemultirests" SUBSECTcodemultirests
.index "&%codemultirests%&"
.index "rests" "repeated bars"
.index "repeated rest bars"
.index "many bars rest" "code signs"
By default, when there are consecutive rest bars in all the staves that are
selected, they are combined into a single bar and output as a `long rest' sign
with the number of bars above. This is the modern convention; in older music,
when the number of bars was between two and eight, coded signs were used
instead, as shown in this example:

.music "music54" 32 4,-20

If &%codemultirests%& is specified, PMW follows this older convention.
Otherwise, multiple rests are all shown in the same way as the nine bars rest
above. This directive can be cancelled in a subsequent movement by specifying
&%nocodemultirests%&.



.subsection "Copyzero"
.index "&%copyzero%&"
This directive makes it possible to have copies of stave zero over any number
of staves. It is followed by a list of stave numbers, each of which may be
optionally followed by a slash and a dimension. Details of the use of
&%copyzero%& are given in section &<<SECTstave0>>&.



.subsection "Cuegracesize"
.index "&%cuegracesize%&"
This directive, which takes a single number as an argument, specifies the font
size to be used for grace notes in bars containing cue notes. See the &%[cue]%&
directive for further details.


.subsection "Cuesize"
.index "&%cuesize%&"
This directive, which takes a single number as an argument, specifies the font
size to be used for cue notes. See the &%[cue]%& directive for further details.



.subsection "Dotspacefactor"
.index "&%dotspacefactor%&"
.index "spacing" "dotted notes"
.index "notes" "spacing for dotted"
This directive specifies the factor by which the horizontal space after a
dotted note is extended. The default value is 1.2.
.code
dotspacefactor 1.5
.endd
In this example, the amount of space that follows a dotted note is 1.5 times
the amount that would follow an undotted note of the same type. (Of course,
when several staves are involved, the value is a minimum, because the notes on
the other staves may cause additional spacing.) When a note is double-dotted,
half as much space again is added. Thus in the default case a double-dotted
note occupies 1.3 times the space of an undotted note.



.subsection "Doublenotes" SUBSECTdoublenotes
.index "&%doublenotes%&"
.index "doubling note lengths"
.index "notes" "doubling length"
.index "time signatures" "modified"
This directive, which applies to the current movement only, causes the length
of each note to be doubled throughout the movement. It also affects the current
time signature and any subsequent time signature settings as follows:
.ilist
&`C`& and &`A`& are turned into &`2*C`& and &`2*A`&, that is, they are shown
as before, but the bar length is doubled.
.next
Other time signatures are changed by halving the denominator, unless the
denominator is 1, in which case the numerator is doubled instead. For example,
4/4 becomes 4/2, but 4/1 becomes 8/1.
.endlist
An entire movement can be formatted in different ways by adding or removing
&%doublenotes%&, without any other changes. If you do not want time signatures
to be affected, use the &%[doublenotes]%& stave directive instead (&R;
&<<SUBSECTstavedoublenotes>>&). Note length adjustment is cumulative; for
example, if &%doublenotes%& appears twice, notelengths are quadrupled. See also
&%halvenotes%& (&R; &<<SUBSECThalvenotes>>&).



.subsection "Draw"
.index "&%draw%&"
The &%draw%& directive is used for defining simple drawn shapes. A full
description of this facility is given in chapter &<<CHAPdraw>>&.



.subsection "Drawbarlines"
.index "&%drawbarlines%&"
This directive, which takes no arguments, is permitted only in the first
movement. It has exactly the same effect as the &%-drawbarlines%& command line
option, which is to cause bar lines to be output as drawing commands instead of
using characters in the music font.



.subsection "Drawstavelines"
.index "&%drawstavelines%&"
This directive is permitted only in the first movement. It has exactly the same
effect as the &%-drawstavelines%& command line option, which is to cause staves
to be output as drawing commands instead of using characters in the music font.
Like the command line option, &%drawstavelines%& can be followed by an integer
argument, which specifies the thickness of the stave lines, in units of one
tenth of a point. If this is not given, the default thickness is 0.3 points.



.subsection "Endlinesluradjust and endlinetieadjust"
.index "&%endlinesluradjust%&"
.index "&%endlinetieadjust%&"
.index "slurs" "line ending"
.index "ties" "line ending"
When a slur or a tie is continued onto the next line, the first part is
normally drawn right up to the end of the first line. Some editors prefer it to
stop a little short of this; &%endlinesluradjust%& and &%endlinetieadjust%&
specify a dimension that is added to the right-hand end of such slurs and ties,
respectively. Normally the value given is a small negative dimension. The value
for ties also applies to glissandos.



.subsection "Endlineslurstyle and endlinetiestyle"
.index "&%endlineslurstyle%&"
.index "&%endlinetiestyle%&"
.index "slurs" "shape of continued"
.index "ties" "shape of continued"
Each part of a continued slur or tie is normally drawn as a complete slur, that
is, with both ends tapering to a point, which is the most commonly found style.
Some editors, however, prefer each portion to have the appearance of half a
normal slur. &%Endlineslurstyle%& and &%endlinetiestyle%& specify this
behaviour when style 1 is selected. The default is style 0.



.subsection "Eps"
This directive is an obsolete synonym for
.code
output eps
.endd
It dates from before PDF output was available. Please see the &%output%&
directive (&R; &<<SECToutput>>&).



.subsection "Extenderlevel" SECTextlevel
.index "&%extenderlevel%&"
.index "underlay" "extender level"
.index "level" "of extender lines"
The vertical level of extender lines, which are drawn when the last syllable of
an underlaid or overlaid word extends over several notes, can be altered by
this directive. It takes a positive or negative number as its argument. This
specifies a number of points, positive numbers moving the lines up, and
negative ones down. Extender lines are output using  underscore characters, and
the default level is just below the baseline of the text.
.code
extenderlevel 1
.endd
This example moves extender lines up to near the baseline, and larger values
can be used to place them nearer the middle of the text characters.



.subsection "Fbsize"
.index "&%fbsize%&"
.index "figured bass" "size"
By default, text that is specified as being part of a figured bass is output
at the same default size as other textual items (10 points). This directive
enables a different point size to be chosen for the figured bass text.
.code
fbsize 8.2
.endd
This example specifies a somewhat smaller font. Individual figured bass text
strings can have an explicit size specified (&R; &<<SECTtextitems>>&).



.subsection "Footing"
.index "&%footing%&"
.index "footing" "for first page"
.index "page footing" "for first page"
This directive has the same arguments as &%heading%&, and they have the same
meaning &-- see &%heading%& below for a full description. Several footing lines
may be specified. &%Footing%& sets up text for the foot of the first page only,
and setting any footing line for a new movement automatically cancels all the
footings that were in force for the previous movement.
.code
footing "Copyright \c) 1992 J.S. Bach"
.endd
Note the use of the escape sequence &`\c)`& in this example to obtain a
copyright symbol. If a type size argument is not given, 8-point type is used.
As is the case with headings, if the left-hand part of a footing (the text
before the first &`|`& character) is longer than the line length, it is split
up into as many lines as necessary, and all but the last are fully justified.

Footing lines are placed below the bottom of the page, as specified by the
&%pagelength%& directive, the first one being 20 points below. This is an
absolute distance that does not change if the magnification is altered.
However, the distance between footings and the sizes of fonts used are subject
to magnification.

See the &%pagefooting%& and &%lastfooting%& directives for a means of setting
up footings for pages other than the first. If no &%footing%& directive is
present, text specified by &%pagefooting%& is output on the first page as well
as on subsequent pages. If the movement is only one page long, &%footing%&
overrides &%lastfooting%&, but &%lastfooting%& overrides &%pagefooting%&.


.subsection "Footnotesep"
.index "&%footnotesep%&"
This directive specifies the amount of extra vertical white space to leave
between multiple footnotes on the same page. The default is 4 points. See the
&%[footnote]%& directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTfootnote>>&) for a full description of
footnotes, which should not be confused with footings.


.subsection "Footnotesize"
.index "&%footnotesize%&"
This directive sets the default type size used for footnotes. If it is not
present, the default size is 9 points. Individual footnotes may specify
different sizes.



.subsection "Gracesize"
.index "&%gracesize%&"
.index "grace notes"
The default size of the music font used for grace notes is 7 points. This
directive allows a different size to be chosen. It must be followed by a number
specifying a point size for the font.



.subsection "Gracespacing"
.index "&%gracespacing%&"
.index "grace notes"
.index "notes" "grace"
By default, a grace note is placed 6 points to the left of the note that
follows it. If there are two or more grace notes, the distance between them is
also 6 points by default. This directive allows these values to be changed. It
must be followed by either one or two arguments. If only one argument is
given, its value is used for both dimensions. If two arguments are given, the
first affects the distance between the last grace note and the following main
note, and the second affects the distance between multiple grace notes.
If the value of either argument is preceded by a plus or a minus sign, it
indicates a change to the existing value. If no sign is present, the number
specifies an absolute value.
.code
gracespacing +2
.endd
This example increases both dimensions by 2 points.
.code
gracespacing -1 8
.endd
This example reduces the space after the last grace note by one point, and sets
the distance between multiple grace notes to 8 points.



.subsection "Gracestyle"
.index "&%gracestyle%&"
.index "grace notes"
.index "notes" "grace"
When two or more staves are selected, and a note on one stave is preceded by
one or more grace notes, the notes on the other staves that fall at the same
point in the bar are output directly above or below the main note, leaving the
grace notes sticking out to the left. This is, of course, the conventional
practice in modern music. The &%gracestyle%& directive, which must be followed
by 0 or 1, can be used to make PMW behave differently.

When the style is set to 1, the notes that are not preceded by grace notes are
aligned with the first grace note on other staves. In addition, if underlaid
text is present, it is aligned to start at the first grace note instead of
being centred on the main note. This facility can be used, in combination with
setting the grace note size equal to the main note size, and using notes with
no stems (see &%[noteheads]%&), for some forms of plainsong music.
.index "plainsong"



.subsection "Hairpinlinewidth"
.index "&%hairpinlinewidth%&"
.index "width" "of hairpin lines"
This directive specifies the width of line used to draw crescendo and
diminuendo hairpins. Its argument is a width in points. The default width of
hairpin lines is 0.2 points. The number may be preceded by a plus or a minus
sign, indicating a change to the existing value. If neither of these is
present, the number specifies an absolute value. Making hairpin lines thicker
may help alleviate jagged effects on long hairpins on high resolution printers.



.subsection "Hairpinwidth"
.index "&%hairpinwidth%&"
.index "width" "of hairpin openings"
This directive specifies the default vertical width of the open end of
hairpins. Its argument is the number of points.
.code
hairpinwidth 5.6
.endd
The number may be preceded by a plus or a minus sign, indicating a change to
the existing value. If neither of these is present, the number specifies an
absolute value. The default value for this parameter is 7 points. A different
width may be set for any individual hairpin (&R; &<<SUBSECThairpinwidth>>&).



.subsection "Halfflatstyle"
.index "&%halfflatstyle%&
.index "accidentals" "half sharps and flats"
.index "flat, half"
.index "half flat"
This directive selects which character to use for a half flat. It must be
followed by one of the numbers 0 (the default) or 1. There is an illustration
of the different styles in section &<<SUBSECThalfaccs>>&.



.subsection "Halfsharpstyle"
.index "&%halfsharpstyle%&
.index "accidentals" "half sharps and flats"
.index "sharp, half"
.index "half sharp"
This directive selects which character to use for a half sharp. It must be
followed by one of the numbers 0 (the default) or 1. There is an illustration
of the different styles in section &<<SUBSECThalfaccs>>&.



.subsection "Halvenotes" SUBSECThalvenotes
.index "&%halvenotes%&"
.index "halving note lengths"
.index "notes" "halving length"
.index "time signatures" "modified"
This directive, which applies to the current movement only, causes the length
of each note to be halved throughout the movement. It also affects the current
time signature and any subsequent time signature settings as follows:
.ilist
&`C`& and &`A`& cannot be halved. The signatures &`2*C`& and &`2*A`& can be
halved, and turn into &`C`& and &`A`& respectively.
.next
Other time signatures are changed by doubling the denominator. For example, 4/4
becomes 4/8.
.endlist
An entire movement can be formatted in different ways by adding or removing
&%halvenotes%& without any other changes. If you do not want time signatures to
be affected, use the &%[halvenotes]%& stave directive instead (&R;
&<<SUBSECTstavehalvenotes>>&). Note length adjustment is cumulative; for
example, if &%halvenotes%& appears twice, notelengths are divided by four. See
also &%doublenotes%& (&R; &<<SUBSECTdoublenotes>>&).



.subsection "Heading" SUBSECTheading
.index "&%heading%&"
.index "heading" "for first page"
.index "page heading" "for first page"
The &%heading%& directive defines a line of text as a heading for the piece or
movement. If no headings are specified, no space is left at the top of the
first page. You can specify any number of headings, which may appear in two
different forms. In the more common form, the keyword is followed by up to
three arguments:
.display
&`heading`& <&'fontsize'&> &`"`&<&'text'&>&`"`& <&'depth'&>
.endd
.index "heading" "size of type"
The first argument is a number, and is optional. If present, it defines the
font size for this heading, in printer's points. As for all font size sizes, an
aspect ratio and/or shear angle may be specified as well as the basic size. If
this argument is omitted, default sizes are used. For headings at the start of
the piece the default sizes are 17 points for the first heading line, 12 points
for the second, 10 points for the third, and 8 points for the fourth and
subsequent heading lines.
.index "movement" "heading sizes"
For headings at the start of a new movement the default sizes are 12 points for
the first heading line, 10 points for the second, and 8 points for the third
and subsequent heading lines.

The second argument is a string in double-quotes, and must be present. It
defines the contents of the heading.
.index "| (vertical bar) in strings"
The vertical bar character has a special meaning in this text &-- it splits it
up into left-hand, centred and right-hand parts. Characters to the left of the
first vertical bar are output at the left of the page; characters between the
first and second vertical bars are centred on the page; the rest of the text is
output at the right of the page.
.index "paragraphs, in headings"
.index "heading" "paragraph"
If the left-hand part of the text is longer than the line length, it is split
up into as many lines as necessary. All but the last line are fully justified,
by expanding any spaces they contain. The last line is also justified if it is
nearly as long as the line length. Justification does not take place when there
are no spaces in the text.

This facility makes it possible to output paragraphs of introductory text on
title pages or at the start of pieces or movements. Note, however, that PMW
does not set out to be a fully-fledged wordprocessor. Any special characters
required in the text have to be coded explicitly (&R; &<<SECTtextstrings>>&);
they are not provided automatically. The paragraph mechanism should not be used
with text that contains variable data such as the escape sequence for the
current page number, because the splitting and justification happens only once,
when the directive is read. &*Note*&: heading strings do not need to be input
on a single line; line breaks in the string are treated as spaces.

.index "heading" "spacing"
.index "spacing" "heading"
The third argument of &%heading%& is a number and is optional. If present, it
specifies the number of points of vertical space to leave after the heading. It
may be zero; this can be useful for headings of different sizes on different
parts of the same line. It may also be negative; this can be used with an empty
text string to make PMW start higher up the page than it normally does. If the
argument is omitted, the amount of space left after the heading line is equal
to the point size of the text. For the last heading line, the space specified
(or defaulted) is the space between the base line of the heading text and the
top of the first stave of music.

When a heading string is split up by PMW into several lines, the spacing value
given (or defaulted) is used for the space after each line in the paragraph. To
leave space between paragraphs, a heading containing an empty string can be
used. Here are some examples of this form of the &%heading%& directive;
the third one outputs nothing, but leaves 20 points of space.
.code
Heading "|Partita"
Heading 11 "Moderato||J.S. Bach" 14
Heading "" 20
.endd

.index "drawing facility" "headings and footings"
.index "rule, in headings and footings"
The second form of the &%heading%& directive causes a drawing subroutine to be
obeyed at the next heading position (see chapter &<<CHAPdraw>>& for more
details of drawings). The syntax is:
.display
&`heading draw`& <&'argument(s)'&> <&'name'&> <&'optional space'&>
.endd
Arguments are optional. The definition of the drawing must precede such a
heading line in the input file. If no space is given, no vertical movement is
made following the drawing. The origin of the coordinate system is set at the
left-hand side, at the level of the next heading line. For example, to draw a
line right across the page (a horizontal rule) after a heading:
.code
draw rule
  0 0 moveto
  linelength 0 rlineto
  1 setlinewidth stroke
enddraw
heading "|Some Text" 0
heading draw rule 20
.endd
Unlike footings, where the first one is always at a fixed vertical position on
the page, the first heading's vertical position may be affected by the vertical
justification setting (&R; &<<SUBSECTjustify>>&) and/or the top margin setting
(&R; &<<SUBSECTbottommargin>>&). See the &%pageheading%& directive for a means
of setting up headings for pages other than the first.



.subsection "Hyphenstring"
.index "&%hyphenstring%&"
.index "hyphen" "in underlay"
When PMW is outputting rows of hyphens between underlaid syllables, it normally
uses single hyphen characters. This directive can be used to change this. The
argument is specified as a string for generality, but normally only a single
character would be used. For example, longer lines than the default can be
obtained by the use of en-dash characters instead of hyphens. These are
specified in strings by a backslash escape and two successive minus signs:
.code
hyphenstring "\--"
.endd
See section &<<SUBSECTuolayother>>& for other facilities that can be used to
control exactly what appears between underlaid syllables.



.subsection "Hyphenthreshold"
.index "&%hyphenthreshold%&"
.index "hyphen" "multiple in underlay"
PMW automatically inserts hyphens between syllables of underlaid text. When the
distance between the syllables is less than the `hyphen threshold', a single
hyphen is output, centred in the space (unless the syllables are so very close
together that there is no room for even one hyphen). If the space is greater
than the threshold, a number of hyphens are output, the distance between them
being the threshold value divided by three. The default value for the hyphen
threshold is 50 points. The number following this directive may be preceded by
a plus or a minus sign, indicating a change to the existing value. If neither
of these is present, the number specifies an absolute value.



.subsection "IncPMWfont aka IncludePMWfont"
.index "&%incpmwfont%&"
This directive, which takes no arguments, is permitted only in the first
movement. It has exactly the same effect as the &%-incPMWfont%& command line
option, which is to include the PostScript Type 1 version of the PMW-Music font
and/or the PMW-Alpha font in every PostScript output file that needs them. This
directive is ignored when PDF output is selected.



.subsection "Join and joindotted"
.index "&%join%&"
.index "&%joindotted%&"
.index "joining signs"
.index "staves" "joining signs"
The syntax of these directives is the same as for &%bracket%& and &%brace%&.
They control the joining line at the left-hand edge of systems. By default a
solid line is drawn through all staves; these directives can be used to cause
breaks in the line and/or to output a dotted line.
.code
join 1-2, 3-4
.endd
This example causes solid lines to be drawn joining staves 1 and 2, and 3 and
4, leaving a gap between staves 2 and 3.
.code
join 1,2,3,4
.endd
This example causes solid lines to be drawn at the ends of each stave, but gaps
to be left between the staves. &%Join%& and &%joindotted%& can be used
together.
.code
joindotted 1-2
join 1,2
.endd
This example causes a dotted line to be used to join staves 1 and 2, and solid
lines to overprint this at the ends of each stave, leaving the dotted line
between them.



.subsection "Justify" SUBSECTjustify
.index "&%justify%&"
.index "horizontal justification"
.index "vertical justification"
&%Justify%& sets the horizontal and vertical justification parameters. It can
be followed by one or more of the words `left', `right', `top', `bottom', or
`all'. Each occurrence of the &%justify%& header directive completely
re-specifies the justification parameters, in contrast to the stave directive
&%[justify]%&. An appearance of &%justify%& that is not followed by one of the
above words requests no justification in any direction. The default value for
justification is `all', that is, complete vertical and horizontal
justification. The effect of the horizontal parameters is as follows:
.ilist
When `left' is specified without `right', each music system starts at the
left-hand side of the page, but is not stretched out to the right-hand
side. This is not normal for performing music, but is useful when
creating examples for inclusion in other documents.
.next
When `right' is specified without `left', each music system ends at the
right-hand side, but is not stretched to start at the left.
.next
When both `left' and `right' are specified (the default), each music system
begins at the left-hand side of the page, and is stretched so that it ends at
the right-hand side, unless it covers less than half the linelength, in which
case the behaviour is as if `right' were not specified.
.next
When neither `left' nor `right' is specified, each music system is centred
horizontally on the page. The width of page used for this purpose can be
adjusted by the &%sheetwidth%& directive. This is another style that is useful
for examples and illustrations.
.endlist

The effect of the vertical justification parameters exactly parallels that of
the horizontal ones.
.ilist
When `top' is specified without `bottom', systems are output starting at the
top of the page, using the system gaps specified in the input.
.next
When `bottom' is specified without `top' the systems are again output with the
gaps specified, but this time they are so arranged that the final stave on the
page is exactly at the page depth. This form is useful when generating
PostScript files for inclusion in other PostScript documents.
.next
When both `top' and `bottom' are specified, the first system is output at the
top of the page. If there is more than one system on the page, and if more than
half the page depth has been used, additional space is inserted between
the systems so that the final stave is exactly at the page depth, except that
there is a maximum amount of space that PMW is prepared to insert between any
two systems.
.next
When neither `top' nor `bottom' is specified, the systems are output with the
gaps specified, but the set of systems is centred vertically on the page.
.endlist
The maximum amount of vertical space that PMW is prepared to insert between any
two systems is controlled by a header directive called &%maxvertjustify%&. The
default value is 60 points, which means that if the default system gap of 44
points is in force, the furthest apart any two systems can be is 104 points.
.index "page" "forcing stave to bottom"
To ensure that the bottom stave is always at the bottom of the page under all
circumstances, specify a large value for &%maxvertjustify%&.

In its information output (&R; &<<SECTinfo>>&), after it has listed the layout
of bars on a page, PMW outputs the amount of space left. When vertical
justification is happening, it is this amount of space that is inserted between
systems or at the top of the page. When space is being inserted between
systems, the same amount is inserted between each pair of systems.

Page headings, footings, and page footings are not affected by vertical
justification. However, if `top' is not specified, start of movement headings
are moved down the page. If a new movement starts in the middle of a page that
is stretched vertically, additional space is inserted before the start of the
movement, that is, before its headings (if any), but not between its headings
and its first stave.

The justification parameters persist from one movement to the next, but may be
reset by the appearance of &%justify%& at the start of a new movement. They can
also be changed by the appearance of the stave directive &%[justify]%&. Unlike
the header directive, it specifies &'changes'& in the justification parameters
only, and its effect lasts only until the end of the current movement. See also
the &%topmargin%& and &%bottommargin%& directives for further parameters that
control the layout of pages.



.subsection "Key"
.index "&%key%&"
.index "key signatures" "specifying"
This directive sets a key signature for a movement. It does not carry over to
any subsequent movements. Naturally, it is also possible to set keys on
individual staves and to change them in the middle of the music. Setting the
key in the header is a convenient shorthand. The single argument to the
directive is a key signature in the format described in section
&<<SECTkeysig>>&.
.code
key A$
key BM
.endd
If no key signature is given for a movement, the default is C major.



.subsection "Keysinglebar and keydoublebar"
.index "&%keysinglebar%&"
.index "&%keydoublebar%&"
.index "bar lines" "double"
.index "bar lines" "key change"
.index "double bar lines" "at key change"
.index "key signatures" "bar line at change"
PMW puts a double bar line before a change of key by default. The
&%keysinglebar%& directive can be used to request a single bar line instead;
&%keydoublebar%& can be used to reset the default for a new movement.



.subsection "Keytranspose" SUBSECTkeytranspose
.index "&%keytranspose%&
.index "custom keys" "transposition"
When transposing a piece, for each transposition amount, PMW needs to know two
things: the new key and the number of letter changes for each note. For the
standard keys this information is built in. For example, if you transpose the
key of B up by a semitone, the result is C, and every note has its letter name
increased by one, whereas if the transposition is down a semitone, the new key
is B&flat; with no change of letter.

For custom keys defined by the &%makekey%& directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTmakekey>>&)
the transposition information must be explicitly supplied in one or more
&%keytranspose%& directives. This directive is followed by the name of a key
and then any number of triples that specify a transposition amount, a new key,
and the number of letter changes. An equals sign and a slash are used as
separators. For example:
.code
keytranspose X1 2=X2/1 -1=X3/0
.endd
This example specifies that if the custom key X1 is transposed up by 2
semitones, the new key is X2 and each note's letter name is to be increased by
1 (with G wrapping round to A, of course); if the transposition is down by one
semitone, the new key is X3, with no change of letter. Any number of triples
may be present, or the information can be given in separate directives. If a
transposition is specified more than once, the last value is used. A
transposition of zero may be given. Transpositions whose absolute value is
greater than 11 are adjusted to be in the range -11 to +11.

The &%keytranspose%& directive is not confined to custom keys. It can be used
with standard keys in order to achieve special effects such as re-setting a
part with a key signature using explicit accidentals and no key signature, as
in this example:
.code
key E
keytranspose E 0=N/0
transpose 0
.endd
A hard error occurs if a note cannot be transposed in the manner specified.


.subsection "Keywarn"
.index "&%keywarn%&"
This directive can be used at the start of a new movement to cancel the effect
of &%nokeywarn%& in the previous movement.



.subsection "Landscape"
.index "&%landscape%&"
This directive is permitted only in the first movement. It causes all the
output to be in `landscape' format, that is, with the long side of the page
horizontal. The value of &%linelength%& is interchanged with the value of
&%pagelength%&, and likewise the value of &%sheetwidth%& is interchanged with
&%sheetdepth%&. Subsequent directives affect the new values. The &%landscape%&
directive should appear after any uses of the &%sheetdepth%&, &%sheetdepth%&,
or &%sheetsize%& directives.



.subsection "Lastfooting"
.index "&%lastfooting%&"
.index "footing" "for last page"
.index "page footing" "for last page"
This directive specifies footing material for the last page of music, replacing
any text specified with &%footing%& or &%pagefooting%& for that page. The
arguments are exactly as for &%heading%& or &%footing%&, but long strings are
not automatically split up into multiple lines. &%Lastfooting%& can also be
used to specify a special footing for the last page of an individual movement
in a piece that has several movements. For details, seen the &%[newmovement]%&
directive.



.subsection "Layout" SUBSECTlayout
.index "&%layout%&"
.index "page layout, forcing"
The &%[newline]%& and &%[newpage]%& directives, together with &%notespacing%&,
are useful for occasional overriding of PMW's default layout choices. However,
if a particular layout for an entire piece is required, achieving it with
&%[newline]%&, &%[newpage]%& and &%notespacing%& can be tedious.

The &%layout%& directive makes it possible to specify exactly how many bars are
to be placed in each system, and how many systems are to fit on each page. This
directive applies only to the movement in which it appears. If you use
&%layout%&, changes made by &%notespacing%& will not affect the layout.

It its simplest form, &%layout%& is followed by a list of numbers, separated by
commas or white space. If the list is long, it can be split into several lines
of input (unlike lists of staves in directives such as &%breakbarlines%&). Each
number in the list specifies the number of bars in a system. If there are more
systems than numbers, the list is restarted from the beginning.
.code
layout 4
.endd
This example specifies that every system (except possibly the last one) is to
contain exactly four bars.
.index "semicolon" "in layout list"
.index "; (semicolon)" "in layout list"
If page breaks are required at particular points, they are specified by a
semicolon in the layout list.
.code
layout 4, 3; 5, 4, 4;
.endd
This example specifies two pages, the first containing two systems and the
second three systems. If too many systems are specified for a page, PMW inserts
a page break of its own. If the width of the bars specified for a system is
greater than the linelength, they are compressed until they fit; if too many
are specified the result may be very cramped. If the same item or sequence of
items is repeated in a layout list, it can be enclosed in parentheses and
preceded by a repeat count. Parentheses can be nested.
.code
layout 3(4, 5(6);)
.endd
This example defines three pages, each consisting of one system of four bars
followed by five systems of six bars. Note the difference between the following
two examples:
.code
layout 2(4,3;)
layout 2(4,3);
.endd
The first specifies two pages, each containing two systems; the second
specifies one page containing four systems.



.subsection "Ledgerstyle"
.index "ledger lines" "thicker style"
The &%ledgerstyle%& directive, which must be followed by 0 or 1, can be used to
choose between thinner or a thicker ledger lines. The default is 0, which
selects the thinner line; on some printers this may look too insignificant,
which is why the thicker style is provided.



.subsection "Leftmargin"
.index "&%leftmargin%&"
Normally, PMW centres page images horizontally on the paper. The width of paper
used for this purpose can be specified by &%sheetwidth%&. The &%leftmargin%&
directive can be used to specify a particular left-hand margin instead of
centring.



.subsection "Linelength and pagelength" SUBSECTlinepagelen
.index "&%linelength%&"
.index "&%pagelength%&"
.index "line length"
.index "length" "of line"
.index "page length"
.index "length" "of page"
The &%linelength%& and &%pagelength%& directives specify the size of the page
images that PMW produces; each takes a single argument which is a dimension in
points. The number may be preceded by a plus or a minus sign, indicating a
change to the existing value. If neither of these is present, the number
specifies an absolute value. The default line length is 480 points and the
default page length is 720 points. These values leave generous margins all
round on A4 paper. These two dimensions, together with &%sheetwidth%& and
&%sheetdepth%&, are the only ones that are not affected by magnification. They
define that part of the page on which output is to occur, in absolute terms.



.subsection "Longrestfont"
.index "&%longrestfont%&"
.index "fonts" "long rest numbers"
The font used for the number that appears above a multi-bar rest sign can be
set by means of the this directive. Its arguments are an optional size followed
by a font name.
.code
longrestfont 13 bolditalic
.endd
The default is a 10-point roman font.



.subsection "Magnification"
.index "&%magnification%&"
.index "magnification"
This directive is permitted only in the first movement. It causes all the
output to be magnified or reduced by a specified factor, which can be greater
or less than 1.0. All dimensions in the PMW system are subject to the
magnification factor, &'except'& the line length, page length, sheet width, and
sheet depth, which are absolute values, and which are therefore not affected by
magnification.
.code
magnification 1.5
.endd
This example causes the output to be one and a half times as large as the
default size. A magnification of around 1.2 is good for individual instrumental
parts.
.code
magnification 0.5
.endd
This example reduces the output to half size. Reduction is helpful for full
scores. Magnification or reduction can sometimes be helpful in fitting a piece
onto the paper, though it is more usual to use other directives such as
&%notespacing%& or &%layout%& for this purpose.



.subsection "Makekey" SUBSECTmakekey SUBSECTmakekey
.index "&%makekey%&"
.index "custom keys" "defining"
.index "key signatures" "custom"
.index "key signatures" "non-standard forms"
.index "accidentals" "in key signatures"
This directive is used to define a custom key signature. Its first argument is
the name of one of the custom keys &`X1`& to &`X10`&. This is followed by a
definition of where accidentals exist for this key. Each accidental is
specified by an accidental code followed immediately by a number in the range 0
to 9. The number specifies the position of the accidental for the treble clef.
Zero is the bottom line of the stave, one is the first space, two is the next
line, and so on. Optional spaces may appear between each definition. For
example:
.code
makekey X3 #2 $6
.endd
This example defines a (strange) key in which Gs are sharpened and Ds are
flattened. The accidentals are output from left to right in the order of
definition. Although the definition relates to the treble clef, custom keys can
be used with any clef. For other clefs, the accidental positions are first
raised or lowered as appropriate, then if any accidental ends up too high or
too low, it is lowered or raised by an octave. If the result is not what is
wanted, the &%printkey%& directive can be used to vary what is output for
specific clefs.

.index "half sharp" "in key signatures"
.index "half flat" "in key signatures"
.index "accidentals" "half sharps and flats"
.index "sharp, half"
.index "half sharp"
.index "flat, half"
.index "half flat"
Any accidental can be specified, including half sharps and flats (&`#-`& and
&`$-`&) and even double accidentals or naturals. However, half accidentals are
not supported in MIDI output. Custom keys can be redefined in multiple-movement
pieces. They can be transposed, but only if you supply additional information
in the form of one or more &%keytranspose%& directives (&R;
&<<SUBSECTkeytranspose>>&). If you use a custom key without defining it, it
behaves as C major.

The &%makekey%& directive was added to PMW long after &%printkey%& (&R;
&<<SUBSECTprintkey>>&), which addresses some of the same issues. The
differences are as follows:
.ilist
&%printkey%& affects only what is output for a specific key signature and
clef. The key itself is unaffected and can be transposed.
.next
To use &%printkey%& you need to understand a bit about PMW's music font and how
to `program' character positioning.
.next
&%makekey%& constructs an actual key which can be used with any clef, and which
affects MIDI output (though half accidentals are not supported by MIDI).
.next
Using &%makekey%& is simpler than &%printkey%& but you have to supply
additional information if you want to transpose a custom key.
.endlist


.subsection "Maxbeamslope"
.index "&%maxbeamslope%&"
.index "beaming" "slope"
.index "slope of beams"
This directive can be used to limit the maximum slope of beams. It takes two
numbers as arguments. These are the maximum slopes of beams containing two
notes and beams containing more than two notes, respectively. The default
setting is:
.code
maxbeamslope 0.31 0.33
.endd
The &%[beamslope]%& directive, which sets an explicit slope for a given beam,
is not limited by these maxima. They apply only when PMW is choosing its own
slope.



.subsection "Maxvertjustify"
.index "&%maxvertjustify%&"
This directive is permitted only in the first movement. It controls the maximum
amount of vertical space that PMW is prepared to insert between any two systems
when vertically justifying a page. The default value is 60 points, which means
that if the default system gap is in force, the furthest apart any two systems
can be is 104 points.
.index "page" "forcing stave to bottom"
To ensure that the bottom stave is always at the bottom of the page under all
circumstances, specify a large value for &%maxvertjustify%&.



.subsection "Midichannel" SUBSECTmidichannel
.index "&%midichannel%&"
.index "MIDI" "channel allocation"
This directive allocates a MIDI voice and/or one or more PMW staves to a MIDI
channel, and sets a relative volume for the channel (see also &%midivolume%&).
This information is used only when PMW writes a MIDI output file. The values
set by &%midichannel%& are carried over from one movement to the next, but it
can appear in any movement to alter the settings. There can be up to four
arguments, of which only the first, the channel number, is mandatory. There are
also &%[midichannel]%& and &%[midivoice]%& stave directives that can be used to
change the settings part-way through a movement.

To allocate a particular MIDI voice (also known as a `program' or a `patch' in
MIDI-speak) to a MIDI channel, the voice number preceded by a sharp character,
or the voice name, is given in quotes after the channel number. If a channel's
voice is specified more than once, the last specification overrides the earlier
ones.
.code
midichannel 1 "#57"
midichannel 2 "church organ"
.endd
There are sixteen MIDI channels, numbered 1&--16 (but see the next section for
the special properties of channel 10). There are 128 possible MIDI voices; the
first form of the directive, where the string starts with #, specifies the
voice by a number in the range 1&--128 (but note that it must still be supplied
as a string in quotes). This numbering is in accordance with the &'General
MIDI'& specification, which a number of manufacturers follow. Some MIDI
instruments use the numbers 0&--127 when setting voices manually; for these,
the manually set number of any given instrument is one less than the
corresponding &'General MIDI'& number.

The second form of voice identification uses an index file to translate a name
to a voice number. The file is installed in the PMW &_share_& directory and is
called &_MIDIvoices_&. You can edit it to change or add names. The version
supplied contains voice names taken from the &'General MIDI'& specification.
Because there is some variation in some of the names, you can have more than
one name for any given voice number, and there are some duplicates in the
supplied file.

All staves are initially allocated to MIDI channel 1. This channel allocation
can be changed by giving a list of staves to the &%midichannel%& directive,
with or without a voice name.
.code
midichannel 2 1,3,4-7
midichannel 4 "piano" 8-11
.endd
If no voice name is given, but a voice was set in a previous movement, that
voice is allocated when the current movement is played. If no voice is given in
the first movement, no voice allocation setting is transmitted on the channel,
which allows the voicing to be set manually on the instrument (if it has that
ability). Having set a voice in one movement, you can request `no voice
setting' in a subsequent movement by specifying an empty quoted string.

.index "MIDI" "relative channel volume"
In some MIDI multi-timbral instruments, the different voices are not balanced
with regard to volume, so if the same values are used in the &%midivolume%& or
&%[midivolume]%& directives for different voices, the resulting volumes do not
correspond. To help balance voices, a volume value in the range 0&--15 may be
given after the voice name, preceded by a slash.
.code
midichannel 1 "trumpet"/12 9
.endd
This example has the effect of reducing the volume of notes played via channel
1 by 12/15. This applies to all staves playing via the channel (in this
example, just stave 9). The actual volume used for any MIDI note is 127
multiplied by the channel volume and the stave volume and divided by 225.



.subsection "Midichannel settings for untuned percussion"
.index "untuned percussion"
.index "MIDI" "untuned percussion"
Before describing the final argument of the &%midichannel%& directive, it is
necessary to discuss MIDI's handling of untuned percussion. A single `voice'
can handle a large number of different untuned percussion instruments, by using
the `pitch' of each note to determine which instrument should sound. For
example, C might sound a bass drum and D a snare drum. Electronic keyboards
often have a `keyboard percussion' mode in which the keys correspond to
percussion sounds in this way. For some reason, this multiple instrument has
not been defined as one of the 128 &'General MIDI'& instruments. Instead, the
&'General MIDI'& specification states that MIDI channel 10 is to be used for
this kind of percussion. On MIDI instruments that implement this, it is not
possible to allocate any other voice to channel 10.

The final argument of the &%midichannel%& directive is used to
select an untuned percussion instrument. It must follow a list of staves
(typically just one stave) and consists of a string in quotes that specifies
either the MIDI pitch number, or the instrument name. Note that the other
string argument (the instrument name for a `normal' channel) is placed
immediately after the channel number, whereas this string argument comes last.
.code
midichannel 10 5 "#60"
midichannel 10 6 "triangle"
.endd
These examples specify the use of pitch 60 for stave 5 and the pitch
corresponding to a triangle for stave 6, both on channel 10. As for MIDI
voices, if the string starts with #, it specifies the pitch by number;
otherwise the file &_MIDIperc_& inside the PMW &_share_& directory is searched
to translate the name to a number. The supplied file contains the name
allocation that appears in the &'General MIDI'& specification. The effect of
supplying this argument is to force all notes on the stave to be played at the
same pitch, independent of the pitch that is given for display. A percussion
stave could therefore be set up thus:
.code
midichannel 10 4 "cowbell"
[stave 4/1 "Cowbell" hclef 1]
b r b r | ...
.endd
After the stave number, &`/1`& defines a stave containing only one line. The
notes are specified as Bs so that they appear on the stave line, but they are
played at the pitch that activates the cowbell sound, provided channel 10 is a
&'General Midi'& percussion channel. For an alternative way of handling untuned
percussion, see the &%[printpitch]%& directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTprintpitch>>&).



.subsection "Midifornotesoff"
.index "&%midifornotesoff%&"
.index "MIDI" "for invisible notes"
Notes that are suppressed in by the use of &%[notes off]%& are by default also
omitted from MIDI output. The header directive &%midifornotesoff%& alters PMW's
behaviour so that &%[notes off]%& no longer affects MIDI output.



.subsection "Midistart"
.index "&%midistart%&"
.index "MIDI" "initializing"
The &%midistart%& directive is followed by a list of numbers in the range
0&--255. When a MIDI file is being created, the MIDI data defined by these
numbers is written to the file after PMW's normal initialization. Each number
defines a byte of MIDI data, and the whole sequence should consist of a
sequence of MIDI events that are to be obeyed at time zero when the file is
played. You must not attempt to supply any time information. PMW automatically
arranges for all these MIDI events to be specified at time zero by inserting a
zero byte before any value that is greater than 127. This feature can be used
by those familiar with the MIDI coding to do things like changing the stereo
position of the channels.
.code
midistart 176 10 0  177 10 40  178 10 80  179 10 120
.endd
This example pans channels 1&--4 evenly from full left (0) to nearly full right
(120). The &%midistart%& setting is carried forward from the movement in which
it is specified to all subsequent movements that do not have their own setting.



.subsection "Miditempo"
.index "&%miditempo%&"
.index "MIDI" "tempo setting"
.index "tempo for playing"
This directive is used to specify the tempo that is used when PMW creates a
MIDI output file. It must have at least one argument, which is the tempo to be
used at the start of the movement. The tempo is always specified in crotchets
per minute, whatever the time signature. The initial setting can optionally be
followed by pairs of numbers separated by slashes, to specify changes of tempo
at particular bars.
.code
miditempo 100 24/120 60/90
.endd
This example specifies that the initial tempo is to be 100, but at the start of
bar 24 it changes to 120, and at the start of bar 60 it changes to 90. Bar
numbers are given in the standard PMW style; if there are uncounted bars then
decimal fractions can be used to refer to them (&R; &<<SECTident>>&).
If no &%miditempo%& directive is present, a default tempo of 120 is used.

If there is more than one movement, the initial tempo specified in a
&%miditempo%& directive carries over to the next movement (unless it contains
its own &%miditempo%& directive, of course), but tempo changes within a
movement do not. However, PMW cannot write more than one movement at a time to
a MIDI output file (see the &%-midimovement%& command line argument in chapter
&<<CHAPrunningpmw>>&).



.subsection "Miditranspose"
.index "&%miditranspose%&"
.index "MIDI" "transposing parts"
.index "transposing parts"
.index "transposing instruments"
.index "transposition" "for playing"
By default, PMW plays music exactly as written, except for recognizing
transposing clefs. If the piece contains a part for a transposing instrument it
will not play correctly. The &%miditranspose%& directive is provided to help
with this. It is used to specify that particular staves are to be played at a
pitch different to that at which they are shown on the stave. &%Miditranspose%&
is followed by pairs of numbers separated by slashes; the first number of each
pair is a stave number and the second is a transposition in semitones.
.code
miditranspose 1/-3
.endd
This example specifies that stave 1 is to be played a minor third lower than
written. There is also a &%[miditranspose]%& stave directive that can be used
to change the transposition part-way through a stave.



.subsection "Miditremolo" SUBSECTmiditremolo
.index "&%miditremolo%&"
.index "MIDI" "tremolo"
.index "tremolo" "in MIDI output"
When generating MIDI output, PMW recognises two kinds of tremolo: &'Repeat'&
tremolos cause a single note to be repeated many times, and are notated in PMW
using a note option, for example &`G\///\`&. &'Trill'& tremolos cause a
repeated alternation between two notes, and are notated using the &%[tremolo]%&
directive, for example &`G[tremolo]B`&.

Whereas repeat tremolos can sound quite reasonable on a MIDI keyboard
instrument, they may sound weird on strings. The &%miditremolo%& directive can
be used to set default tremolo handling on all staves. There is also a
&%[miditremolo]%& stave directive for individual stave control. Each must be
followed by one of the following words:
.itable none 0 0 2  80 left  200 left
.row &`both`&   "both kinds of tremolo are played"
.row &`none`&   "no tremolos are played"
.row &`repeat`& "only repeat tremolos are played"
.row &`trill`&  "only trill tremolos are played"
.endtable
If your MIDI player supports the &'tremolo strings'& instrument, you could use
a macro to change to it for just one note:
.display
&`*define ST() [miditremolo none midivoice "tremolo strings"] &&&&&&`&
  &`&&&&1 [miditremolo trill midivoice "strings 1"]`&
.endd
Note the use of three ampersands to continue the logical line onto the second
input line. The macro could then be used like this: &`&&ST(A\///\)`&. However,
remember that changing a voice affects all staves that are using the same MIDI
channel.


.subsection "Midivolume" SUBSECTmidivolume
.index "&%midivolume%&"
.index "MIDI" "volume"
.index "volume for playing"
The &%midivolume%& directive is used to set different relative volumes for
different staves. The value for a relative volume lies between 0 (silent) and
15 (maximum volume). By default, all staves are set at the maximum volume. A
single number sets the volume for all staves; this can be followed by pairs of
numbers separated by slashes, to specify relative volumes for individual
staves.
.code
midivolume 6 2/15
.endd
This example specifies that stave 2 is to be played at maximum volume, whereas
all other staves are to be played at volume 6. See also the &%[midivolume]%&
stave directive, and &%midichannel%&, which can set a per-channel volume. The
final volume used for any MIDI note is 127 multiplied by the channel volume and
the stave volume and divided by 225.



.subsection "Midkeyspacing"
.index "&%midkeyspacing%&"
.index "space" "for mid-line signatures"
When a mid-line bar starts with a key signature, the &%startlinespacing%& data
is used for any time signature that follows, but not for the key signature
itself. Instead, &%midkeyspacing%& controls the position of such key
signatures. It takes a single dimension as its argument; a positive value moves
the signature further away from the preceding bar line.



.subsection "Midtimespacing"
.index "&%midtimespacing%&"
When a mid-line bar starts with a time signature, its position can be
controlled by the &%midtimespacing%& directive, which takes a single dimension
as its argument. A positive value moves the signature further away from the
preceding bar line.



.subsection "Musicfont"
.index "&%musicfont%&"
.index "fonts" "alternative music"
This directive is permitted only in the first movement. It specifies, as a
string in quotes, the name of the music font to be used by PMW; its argument
is a text string. The facility is intended for accessing new or alternative
versions of the font. The default music font is PMW-Music.



.subsection "Nobeamendrests"
.index "&%nobeamendrests%&"
This directive, which has no arguments, can be used to cancel the effect of
&%beamendrests%& in a previous movement.



.subsection "Nocheck"
.index "&%nocheck%&"
.index "checking bar lengths"
This directive, which has no arguments, instructs PMW not to check that the
notes in each bar agree with the time signature. It is also possible to
suppress this check for individual bars (&R; &<<SUBSECTstavenocheck>>&).



.subsection "Nocheckdoublebars"
.index "&%nocheckdoublebars%&"
.index "checking bar lengths"
.index "bar lines" "double"
.index "double bar lines" "suppressing bar length check"
This directive, which has no arguments, instructs PMW not to check that the
notes in bars that begin or end with a double bar line agree with the time
signature.



.subsection "Nocodemultirests"
.index "&%nocodemultirests%&"
This directive cancels the effect of &%codemultirests%& in a previous movement.



.subsection "Nokerning"
.index "&%nokerning%&"
This directive is permitted only in the first movement. It disables the use of
kerning for text strings (&R; &<<SUBSECTkerning>>&).



.subsection "Nokeywarn"
.index "&%nokeywarn%&"
.index "key signatures" "suppressing warning"
.index "warning signatures"
By default, when there is a key signature change at the start of a new system,
PMW also puts the new key signature at the end of the previous system, as is
conventional in most music. The header directive &%nokeywarn%& suppresses
these warning key signatures. Individual occurrences can be suppressed by an
option on the &%[key]%& stave directive that changes the key signature.



.subsection "Nosluroverwarnings"
.index "&%nosluroverwarnings%&"
.index "warning signatures"
This directive, which has no arguments, can be used to cancel the effect of
&%sluroverwarnings%& in a previous movement.



.subsection "Nospreadunderlay"
.index "&%nospreadunderlay%&"
.index "underlay" "suppressing note spreading"
By default, PMW inserts additional space between notes if underlaid or overlaid
syllables would otherwise overprint each other. This directive disables this
facility for both underlaid and overlaid text.



.subsection "Notespacing"
.index "&%notespacing%&"
.index "notes" "spacing"
.index "spacing" "notes"
PMW contains a table of the minimum amount of horizontal space that follows
each kind of note; so much for a breve, so much for a semibreve, so much for a
minim, and so on. Systems are made up using these spacings, until a bar is
encountered which would make the system longer than the specified line length.
The previous bars are then stretched to fill the line if horizontal
justification is enabled.

The &%notespacing%& directive allows the table to be altered. It must be
followed by eight numbers that define the space (in points) that must follow
breves, semibreves, minims, crotchets, quavers, semiquavers, demi-semiquavers
and hemi-demi-semiquavers respectively. The values in the default table are
those of the following example:
.code
notespacing 30 30 22 16 12 10 10 10
.endd
Internally, note spacings are held to an accuracy of 0.001 points. An
alternative form of this directive specifies a multiplicative factor for each
value in the table. This is requested by following the directive by an asterisk
and a single number, or by two numbers separated by a slash.
.code
notespacing *1.5
notespacing *3/2
.endd
Each of these examples specifies that the values in the note spacing table are
to be multiplied by 1.5. If more than one multiplicative &%notespacing%& is
present, their effect is cumulative, but a multiplicative &%notespacing%& is
overridden if it is followed by an absolute setting. At the start of a new
movement, the absolute values that were current at the start of the previous
movement, before any multiplications, are re-instated.

Changing the note spacing is one way of controlling the assignment of bars to
systems and systems to pages. For example, if in the default state the last page
contains only two bars, a small reduction in the note spacing may enable the
whole piece to fit onto the previous page(s). On the other hand, if the final
page is not being fully used, increasing the notespacing by a small amount can
cause it to be filled out. You can also make temporary changes to the note
spacing table for certain bars of the music only (&R; &<<SUBSECTstavens>>&).

Another way of controlling the assignment of bars to systems is to use the
&%layout%& header directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTlayout>>&). If you are using
&%layout%&, changes made by &%notespacing%& will not affect the layout.



.subsection "Notime"
.index "&%notime%&"
.index "time signatures" "suppressing"
This directive, which has no arguments, specifies that time signatures are not
to be shown for the current movement. It does not stop PMW from checking the
notes in a bar and complaining if there are too many or too few (see
&%nocheck%& if you want to suppress this). &%Notime%& does not affect
subsequent movements. See also &%startnotime%&.



.subsection "Notimebase"
.index "&%notimebase%&"
.index "time signatures" "one number only"
This directive requests that only the `numerator' (that is, the upper number)
in time signatures be shown, in the middle of the stave. For example, in 3/4
time, only the 3 would appear. Both numbers are required to be given when
specifying time signatures, however. This directive has no effect on time
signatures specified as C or A. See also the &%printtime%& directive for
another way of customizing time signatures.



.subsection "Notimewarn"
.index "&%notimewarn%&"
.index "time signatures" "suppressing warning"
.index "warning signatures"
By default, when there is a time signature change at the start of a new system,
PMW also puts the new time signature at the end of the previous line, as is
conventional in most music. The header directive &%notimewarn%& suppresses
these warning time signatures. Individual occurrences can be suppressed by an
option on the &%[time]%& stave directive that changes the time signature.



.subsection "Nounderlayextenders"
.index "&%nounderlayextenders%&"
This directive suppresses extender lines at the ends of underlay words whose
last syllable extends over more than one note. In a subsequent movement
&%underlayextenders%& can be used to restore them.



.subsection "&%Nowidechars%&"
.index "&%nowidechars%&"
This directive, which takes no arguments, is permitted only in the first
movement. It has exactly the same effect as the &%-nowidechars%& command line
option, which is to disable the use of very wide characters as part of stave
lines. This option is ignored if &%drawstavelines%& is set.



.subsection "Output" SECToutput
.index "&%eps%&"
.index "PostScript" "encapsulated"
.index "encapsulated PostScript (EPS)"
.index "output format" "choosing"
This directive is permitted only in the first movement. It must be followed by
one of the words `PDF', `PostScript', `PS', or `EPS'. It sets the format of the
output that PMW generates, and has the same effect as the &%-pdf%&, &%-ps%&, or
&%-eps%& command line options. An error occurs if conflicting settings are
given.



.subsection "Overlaydepth"
.index "&%overlaydepth%&"
.index "overlay" "line depth"
If two or more character strings, all designated as overlay, are attached to
the same note, they are automatically placed one above the other. The
distance between the baselines of the strings can be set by this directive. The
default depth is 11 points. The overlay depth and the underlay depth are
separate parameters.



.subsection "Overlaysize"
.index "&%overlaysize%&"
.index "overlay" "size"
By default, text that is specified as being vocal overlay is output using a
10-point font. This directive enables a different point size to be chosen for
overlaid text.
.code
overlaysize 9.7
.endd
Individual items of overlay text can be specified at different sizes by using
the &`/s`& or &`/S`& text qualifier. The overlay size and the underlay size are
separate parameters.



.subsection "Page"
.index "&%page%&"
.index "page numbers"
.index "numbering pages"
This directive is permitted only in the first movement. By default, page
numbers start from one. The &%page%& directive can be used to specify that they
should start at a different number. It takes the number of the first page as
its first argument. There is also a second, optional argument that gives the
increment by which page numbers are advanced.
.code
page 3 2
.endd
This example might be used in a file containing the &'primo'& part of a piano
duet. It causes the pages to be numbered 3, 5, 7, etc. Occasionally there is a
requirement to skip a page number in the middle of a piece &-- to insert a
commentary page in a critical edition, for example. See the &%[page]%& stave
directive for a means of doing this.



.subsection "Pagefooting"
.index "&%pagefooting%&"
.index "footing" "for middle pages"
.index "page footing" "for middle pages"
The &%pagefooting%& directive defines text for the foot of pages. If a
&%footing%& directive is present, it overrides &%pagefooting%& for the first
page only. The &%lastfooting%& directive can be used to override it for the
final page of a piece. The arguments for &%pagefooting%& are the same as those
for &%footing%&, but long strings are not automatically split up into multiple
lines. Note the use of the escape sequences &`\p\`&, &`\po\`&, and &`\pe\`& to
include page numbers in footing lines.



.subsection "Pageheading"
.index "&%pageheading%&"
.index "heading" "for middle pages"
.index "page heading" "for middle pages"
The &%pageheading%& directive defines text for the head of pages other than the
first. Its arguments are the same as those for &%heading%&, but long strings
are not automatically split up into multiple lines. Note the use of the escape
sequences &`\p\`&, &`\po\`&, and &`\pe\`& to include page numbers in heading
lines. See section &<<SUBSECTmovement>>& and also the &%[newmovement]%&
directive for discussions of headings when there is more than one movement in a
file.



.subsection "Pagelength"
This directive is permitted only in the first movement. See section
&<<SUBSECTlinepagelen>>& (&'Linelength and pagelength'&) above.



.subsection "PMWversion"
.index "&%pmwversion%&"
.index "version of PMW, checking"
.index "PMW version, checking"
This directive checks the version of PMW is in use. It must be followed by a
version number or a version number preceded by &`>`& (greater than), &`>=`&
(greater than or equal), &`<`& (less than), &`<=`& (less than or equal), &`=`&
or &`==`& (equal, same as no sign):
.code
pmwversion    4.50
pmwversion >= 5.00
pmwversion <  5.00
.endd
If the wrong version is used, a message is output and PMW stops.



.subsection "Printkey" SUBSECTprintkey
.index "&%printkey%&"
.index "key signatures" "specifying output format"
.index "key signatures" "non-standard forms"
.index "accidentals" "in key signatures"
.index "half sharp" "in key signatures"
.index "half flat" "in key signatures"
Some old music uses key signatures in which the accidentals are placed
differently to the modern convention. For example, for a treble clef G major
signature, the sharp is on the bottom space of the stave instead of on the top
line. The &%printkey%& directive can be used to reproduce such usage. It can
also be used to specify the appearance of half sharps and half flats in key
signatures. Another way of doing this (a more recent addition to PMW) is to use
the &%makekey%& directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTmakekey>>&) to define a custom key.
The syntax of &%printkey%& is as follows:
.display
&`printkey `&<&'key'&>&` `&<&'clef'&>&` "`&<&'string'&>&`" "`&<&'string'&>&`"`&
.endd
There may be many occurrences of &%printkey%& in a single input file. The
directive applies to the movement in which it occurs, and any subsequent
movements, unless overridden by a subsequent &%printkey%& directive with the
same key and clef. The most recent occurrence is always the one that is used.
The use of &%printkey%& affects only what is output for the given key/clef
combination. It has no other effect on PMW's behaviour.

The first string specifies what is to appear instead of the normal key
signature. The second string is optional, and specifies what is to appear for a
`cancellation' key signature, that is, when there is a change to a key with an
empty signature. If not supplied, this string is set empty.

The string is normally a sequence of characters in the music font, which is set
as the default font at the start of the string. The size is fixed at 10 points,
scaled to the stave's magnification. You can change to other fonts by means of
the usual escape sequences, but the size cannot be varied. The starting
vertical position is the bottom line of the stave; you can use the up and down
moving characters in the music font to position accidentals (or other
characters) where you want them.
.code
key G
printkey G treble  "\37\" "\40\"
printkey E$ treble "x~\39\x~\191\ww\191\"
printkey E$ bass   "~\39\x~\191\ww\191\"
[stave 1 treble 1]
GG | [key C] GG | [key E$] GG [bass 0] | [key E$] GG ||
[endstave]
.endd

.music "music47" 32 4,-16

In the above example, the G major key signature is displayed as a single sharp
(character 37 in the music font), in the initial vertical position, with a
natural (character 40) in the same position for cancellation. For the E-flat
treble clef signature, characters 120 (&`x`&) and 126 (&`~`&) are used to move
up four and two points, respectively, so that the flat (character 39) is on
the middle line of the stave. Further appearances of &`x`& and &`~`&, and also
character 119 (&`w`&), which moves down four points, are used to position the
half flats (character 191) that follow. A similar string is used for the bass
clef. Details of the music font characters are given in chapter &<<CHAPfont>>&.



.subsection "Printtime"
.index "&%printtime%&"
.index "time signatures" "specifying output format"
Time signatures are occasionally shown in unusual formats. This directive
specifies how a given time signature is to appear. It has the following syntax:
.display
&`printtime `&<&'time signature'&>&` "`&<&'top'&>&`" "`&<&'bottom'&>&`"`&
.endd
There may be many occurrences of &%printtime%& in a single input file. The
directive applies to the movement in which it occurs, and any subsequent
movements, unless overridden by a subsequent &%printtime%& directive for the
same time signature. The most recent occurrence is always the one that is used.
Whenever the given time signature is to be output, the &%printtime%& setting is
used instead. If the second string is empty, the first is output vertically
centred on the stave; otherwise the two strings are output on the third and
first stave lines, respectively, with their horizontal centres
aligning. Some examples of possible uses are:
.code
printtime 8/8  "3+3+2" "8"
printtime 12/8 "3 2"   "2 2"
printtime 3/4  "3"/s2  ""
printtime 3/2 "\**147\" ""
.endd

.music "music63" 36 0,-16

Setting both strings empty suppresses all output for the time signature. The
default font at the start of each string is the font specified by the
&%timefont%& directive for the current movement (as long as it precedes
&%printtime%&) or for an earlier movement. If &%timefont%& is not used, the
default font is the bold font. However, changes of font are permitted within
the strings. The default size of the text for &%printtime%& is that specified
by &%timefont%&, with 11.8 points as the ultimate default. However, as shown in
the third example above, you can follow each text string with &`/s`& or &`/S`&
and a number, to specify a particular size for a given string (&R;
&<<SUBSECTtextsizeoption>>&). For &`s`&, the number refers to the list of text
sizes specified by the &%textsizes%& directive, which in this example has set
size 2 to 20 points. For &`/S`&, the number refers to one of the fixed sizes.
.index "time signatures" "circle"
The fourth example uses character 147 from the music font (requested by the
asterisks) to output an old-fashioned signature in the form of a circle.


.subsection "Rehearsalmarks"
.index "rehearsal marks"
.index "&%rehearsalmarks%&"
This directive controls the way rehearsal marks (&R; &<<SECTrehearse>>&) are
shown. It has this syntax:
.display
&`rehearsalmarks`& <&'align'&> <&'style'&> <&'size'&> <&'fontname'&>
.endd
All the arguments are optional, except that if <&'fontname'&> is present, one
of either <&'style'&> or <&'size'&> (or both) must precede it. Parameters that
are unspecified are left unchanged. The settings are copied to any following
movement, but can be changed therein.

The <&'align'&> argument affects the positioning of rehearsal marks that occur
at the start of the first bar of a system (that is, at the start of a line). By
default, such marks are aligned with the first note in the bar. If
`linestartleft' is present, these marks are instead placed at the start of the
line; `nolinestartleft' can be used to restore the default in a following
movement. If <&'style'&> is present, it must be one of the words `boxed' or
`roundboxed' (enclose in a rectangular box, in the second case with rounded
corners), `ringed' (enclose in a ring), or `plain' (do not enclose). The size
is the font size, and the final argument specifies the font to be used (&R;
&<<SECTtextfonts>>&).
.code
rehearsalmarks boxed 13
rehearsalmarks ringed italic
rehearsalmarks 11 bolditalic
rehearsalmarks linestartleft plain 14 bold
.endd
By default, rehearsal marks are enclosed in a box with mitred corners, using a
12-point roman font.



.subsection "Repeatbarfont"
.index "&%repeatbarfont%&"
.index "fonts" "for repeat bars"
The font used for the numbers on first and second time bars can be set by this
directive. Its arguments are an optional size followed by a non-optional font
name.
.code
repeatbarfont 8 extra 4
.endd
This example specifies the use of the fourth extra font, at an 8-point size.
The default size is 10 points, and the default font is roman. If the &%[1st]%&
or &%[2nd]%& directive specifies a text string to replace the number (&R;
&<<SUBSECTfirstsecond>>&), this font is the default, but can be changed within
the string.



.subsection "Repeatstyle" SUBSECTrepeatstyle
.index "&%repeatstyle%&"
.index "repeat marks"
This directive specifies how repeat marks appear. The default is the
conventional combination of two dots with a thin and a thick vertical line.
In its basic form directive must be followed by one of the following numbers:

.itable none 0 0 2  12 left  200 left
.row &`0`&    "normal style"
.row &`1`&    "no thick vertical line"
.row &`2`&    "no thick vertical line, and thin line dotted"
.row &`3`&    "four dots only (unless at a bar line)"
.row &`4`&    "as 0, but alternate amalgamated form"
.endtable
If style 2 is used at the start or end of a bar, you must use an invisible bar
line if you want to prevent the dotted line being overprinted by a normal bar
line. Style 4 is the same as style 0 (the default) except when the end
of a repeated section is immediately followed by the start of another repeated
section, typically coded as &`:)|(:`& in the input file. In style 0, a thin
line, thick line, and second thin line appear between the dots. This style is
recommended in Gardner Read's &'Music Notation'& and also shown in Kurt Stone's
&'Music Notation in the Twentieth Century'&. However, some editors prefer to
have just two thick lines between the dots, and this is what style 4 gives.

.music "music37" 32 0,-16 centre

.index "repeat marks" "with wings"
When outputting single parts it is common to see repeat marks with small
`wings' above them, to make them more prominent. You can request these by
adding 10 to the argument of &%repeatstyle%&. Thus, a value of 10 generates
repeats like this:

.music "music67" 32 0,-16

You can use conditional pre-processing directives (&R;
&<<SUBSECTconditional>>&) to arrange for wings to appear only in parts, and not
in a score. If there is more than one stave in a system, wings are added to
the top and bottom staves only.


.subsection "Righttoleft" SUBSECTrighttoleft
.index "&%righttoleft%&
.index "layout right to left"
The &%righttoleft%& directive causes PMW to typeset music from right to left
instead of in the conventional left-to-right manner. This directive must appear
in the first movement of a file, and it applies to all the movements that
follow. The facility was ``bolted on'' to the existing PMW code, and as a
result has some awkwardnesses, in particular in the way in which character
strings are handled. It is also somewhat experimental and is likely to give
strange results if some of the more complicated features of PMW are used.
Nevertheless, &%righttoleft%& makes it possible to typeset music in a manner
that is sometimes used in countries whose language is written from right to
left. Although the music runs from right to left, the shapes of the notes,
accidentals, clefs, and other markings are not altered, except for the
horizontal wedge accent &`\>\`&, which is flipped to point the other way.

Right-to-left output is implemented by transforming the coordinate system so
that the x-axis runs to the left and the origin is at the righthand side of the
page image. Within the transformed coordinate system, fonts are themselves
re-transformed so that their characters appear as normal. This means that
characters in text strings are still output from left to right; however, the
positioning of text strings is adjusted so that they end rather than start at
their normal position. There is a further complication if there are font
changes within a text string. The substrings, taken in order in the input file,
are output from right to left, but within each substring, the characters run
from left to right. Note the way that the strings in this example are rendered:

.code
[stave 1 treble 1]
"\*c\\bf\104 = "/a/ts/u2
"m\bi\f" A #g. a- | "abc" c'-b-a-g-; G |
.endd

.music "music50" 48 12,-14

The first string, &`"\*c\\bf\104 = "`& is split into two substrings, the first
being a crotchet character from the music font, and the second being the text
&`"104 = "`& from the bold font. The &`/ts`& option specifies that the string
is positioned at the time signature, so this is where the first substring is
put; the second string is then placed to its left. The second string,
&`"m\bi\f"`&, also uses two fonts, and so the italic &'m'& appears to the
right of the bold italic &'&*f*&'&. The third string has no font changes, so
the characters appear in order.

If PMW has been compiled with B2PF support, you can use the &%b2pffont%&
directive to cause strings in certain fonts to be processed by the B2PF
library, which can convert base characters to presentation forms, and can also
reverse the order of characters in a string.

When right-to-left output is enabled, right and left are interchanged in all
the facilities for moving items horizontally, and for the left-centre-right
feature of heading lines. For example, using &`/r`& on a string moves it left
instead of right. In shapes defined by the &%draw%& directive, x-coordinates
are inverted, with positive values moving left instead of right.

If any of the two-up printing styles is selected when &%righttoleft%& is
enabled, the order of the pages on the sheets is reversed. This makes it
possible to generate correct right-to-left pamphlet-style pages for folding and
binding.



.subsection "Selectstave(s)"
.index "&%selectstave%&"
.index "staves" "selection of"
This directive is used to specify a selection of staves to be output. It
overrides any selection given by the &%-s%& option on the command line. The
directive is followed by a list of staves and/or ranges of staves, and is
intended for use in conjunction with the &%-f%& command line option, as in this
example:
.code
*if chorus
  selectstaves 5-8
*fi
*if cello
  selectstave 4
*fi
.endd
Any tests that rely on a particular stave selection must follow this directive.



.subsection "Sheetdepth, Sheetwidth, and Sheetsize"
.index "&%sheetdepth%&"
.index "&%sheetsize%&"
.index "&%sheetwidth%&"
.index "A3, A4, A5 paper size"
.index "B5 paper size"
.index "size" "of paper"
.index "width" "of paper"
.index "depth of paper"
These three directives are permitted only in the first movement. They are
concerned with specifying the size of page image that PMW creates.
&%Sheetdepth%& and &%sheetwidth%& can be used to specify vertical and
horizontal paper dimensions individually, but for standard sizes it is usually
simpler to use &%sheetsize%&, which must be followed by one of the words `A3',
`A4', `A5', `B5', or `letter'. Its effect is to set the sheet depth and width
parameters to suitable values for the given paper size, and also to set the
&%linelength%& and &%pagelength%& values, as follows:

.itable none 0 0 5  40 centre  64 centre  64 centre  64 centre  64 centre
.row &'Size'& &'Sheetwidth'& &'Sheetdepth'& &'Linelength'& &'Pagelength'&
.row   A3          842           1190           730           1060
.row   A4          595           842            480           720
.row   A5          421           595            366           480
.row   B5          499           709            420           590
.row   letter      612           792            500           670
.endtable

Adjustments to the line length or page length must be made after any appearance
of &%sheetsize%&, which should also precede any occurrence of the &%landscape%&
directive. If A5 or B5 is specified and the page is printed on A4 paper, it
appears by default at the bottom left-hand corner. This position can be
adjusted by using the &%-printadjust%& command line option, or A5 pages can be
printed two-up by specifying &%-a5ona4%&.



.subsection "Shortenstems"
.index "&%shortenstems%&"
.index "stems" "automatic shortening"
Some editors like to shorten note stems that are pointing the `wrong' way
(upward stems for notes above the middle of the stave or downward stems for
notes below the middle of the stave). PMW can be made to do this shortening
automatically. &%Shortenstems%& must be followed by one number, which is the
maximum amount by which a stem may be shortened.
.code
shortenstems 4
.endd
This example allows PMW to shorten stems automatically by up to 4 points. The
default value of zero causes no automatic shortening. Additional shortening (or
lengthening) can be specified explicitly for any given note, and this is added
to any automatic shortening that may be set. PMW maintains an overall minimum
stem length beyond which stems cannot be shortened, so specifying a large limit
such as 99 permits shortening down to this minimum length. Automatic shortening
reduces a stem's length by 0.5 points for each note position on the stave, so,
for example, a note on the top line has its upward-pointing stem shortened by 2
points (provided the &%shortenstems%& limit allows this).



.subsection "Sluroverwarnings"
.index "&%sluroverwarnings%&"
.index "slurs" "over warning signatures"
.index "ties" "over warning signatures"
.index "warning signatures" "slurs and ties over"
When a line ends with a warning time or key signature, and there is a slur or
tie that is continued from this line to the next, PMW does not by default draw
the slur or tie over the warning. This directive requests it to do so.



.subsection "Smallcapsize"
.index "&%smallcapsize%&"
When the escape sequence &`\sc\`& is used in a string to change to small caps,
it selects a new font of the same typeface as before, but at a relative size
that can be set by this directive. The default value is 0.7. &*Note:*& This
applies only to non-music fonts. If &`\sc\`& is used with a music font, it has
the same effect as using &`\mu\`&, that is, it switches to a music font at 0.9
nominal size.



.subsection "Startbracketbar"
.index "&%startbracketbar%&"
This directive applies only to the movement in which it appears; it affects the
first system of the movement. It specifies a number of bars by which the
joining brackets and/or braces that normally appear at the left-hand end are to
be `indented'. The second and subsequent systems are not affected. If the word
`join' appears before the number, the joining lines as specified by the
&%join%& and &%joindotted%& directives are also applied at the actual start of
the system; by default nothing appears there. See section &<<SECTincipit>>& for
an example of the use of &%startbracketbar%&.



.subsection "Startlinespacing"
.index "&%startlinespacing%&"
.index "spacing" "start of line"
.index "clefs" "space before"
This directive controls the spacing of clefs, key signatures, and time
signatures at the start of lines of music. It can be followed by up to four
dimensions. Omitted numbers are taken as zero. The syntax is:
.display
&`startlinespacing`& <&'c'&> <&'k'&> <&'t'&> <&'n'&>
.endd
Each number specifies additional space &'before'& a particular item at the
start of each stave:

.itable none 0 0 2  12 left  200 left
.row &'c'&  "is the extra space before the clef"
.row &'k'&  "is the extra space before the key signature"
.row &'t'&  "is the extra space before the time signature"
.row &'n'&  "is the extra space before the first note"
.endtable

The arguments can be given negative values to move the items closer together.
If an item is absent on a stave, the associated extra space is also omitted.
When a mid-line bar starts with a clef (rare in the ordinary course of events,
but can occur, for example, after an incipit), the &%startlinespacing%& values
are used for the clef and any signatures that follow it, exactly as at the
start of a line. See &%midkeyspacing%& and &%midtimespacing%& for ways of
handling key and time signatures that occur at the start of mid-line bars.



.subsection "Startnotime"
.index "&%startnotime%&"
.index "time signatures" "suppressing"
This directive, which has no arguments, applies only to the movement in which
it appears. It causes no time signature to appear at the start of the movement,
but does not suppress subsequent time signature changes. This is useful for
typesetting parts of pieces. The &%notime%& directive suppresses all time
signatures in a piece.



.subsection "Stavesize(s)"  SUBSECTstavesize
.index "&%stavesizes%&"
.index "size" "of staves"
This directive specifies different sizes for certain staves. It is followed by
pairs of numbers, separated by slashes. The first of each pair is a stave
number, and the second is the size of the stave relative to the standard stave
size.
.code
stavesize 1/0.8
stavesizes 4/1.2 5/1.2 6/1.2
.endd
The first example specifies that stave 1 is 0.8 times the normal size, and the
second specifies that staves 4&--6 are 1.2 times the normal size. A change in
the relative size of a stave affects everything on that stave, both notes and
text items. However, the text that appears to the left of the stave (the
instrument or voice name) is not affected, and neither are bar numbers
.index "bar numbers" "size on scaled stave"
.index "rehearsal marks" "size on scaled stave"
or rehearsal marks. A size may be specified for stave zero if required. As no
notes are ever output on this stave, only text items are affected.
.index "bar lines" "breaking"
.index "bar lines" "thick and thin"
Bar lines are thicker or thinner, as necessary, unless a fixed size has been
specified with &%barlinesize%&. With varying barline thicknesses, it is
conventional to break bar lines between staves of different sizes to avoid ugly
joins.



.subsection "Stavespacing" SUBSECTstavespacing
.index "&%stavespacing%&"
.index "staves" "spacing"
.index "spacing" "staves"
This directive controls the amount of vertical white space between staves.
Whatever is set for one movement carries over as the default for the next
movement. The distance between staves is measured from the bottom of one stave
to the bottom of the next. The initial default is 44 points. If the
&%stavespacing%& directive is followed by a single number, this sets the
spacing for all staves to that value. After such a single number, further items
can be given to set different spacings for individual staves.
.code
stavespacing 50 1/54 3/60
.endd
This example sets the spacing for all staves to 50 points, except for staves 1
and 3, which have their own settings. The initial overall number is optional.
The remaining arguments for this directive consist of pairs or triples of
numbers, separated by a slash. The first number is always a stave number. In
the case of number pairs, the second number specifies the spacing between the
stave and its successor on the page.
.code
stavespacing 1/36 4/50
.endd
This example ensures that staves 1 and 2 are nearer together than the default,
at 36 points, and staves 4 and 5 are further apart at 50 points (assuming
that all these staves are selected).

Sometimes there is a requirement to specify the amount of space &'above'& a
stave. For example, in a piece with an accompaniment and four vocal lines, not
all of which are present throughout the piece, it is a common requirement that
there be more space between the last vocal stave (whichever it is) and the
first accompaniment stave. Changing the stave spacing every time the last vocal
line is suspended or resumed can be avoided by using a triple in the
&%stavespacing%& directive. Whenever three numbers appear as an argument to
&%stavespacing%&, the second number specifies a &'minimum'& space &'above'& the
given stave, and the third specifies the space below it.
.code
stavespacing 1/46 2/50 3/50/48
.endd
This example specifies that stave 3 always has at least 50 points above it,
even when stave 2 is suspended. Space specified above the top stave is ignored,
and, if it is desired to specify space above the last stave, some dummy third
number must be given to fulfil the syntax requirement of three numbers.
The spacing between staves can be varied in the middle of a piece. See the
stave directives &%[ssabove]%&, &%[sshere]%&, and &%[ssnext]%& (&R;
&<<SUBSECTss>>&).

.index "overprinting" "staves"
A value of zero may be given for the spacing. This causes two successive staves
to appear on top of each other, and can be useful for setting two lines of
music on the same stave. It can also be useful for a figured bass line, using
invisible notes to set the horizontal positioning for the figures. However, if
only a few bars of a piece require overprinting, the &%[reset]%& or
&%[backup]%& stave directives may be more convenient than the use of a complete
overprinted stave.



.subsection "Stemlengths"
.index "&%stemlengths%&"
.index "stems" "length adjustment"
This directive is followed by up to six numbers, which specify adjustments to
stemlengths for unbeamed minims, crotchets, quavers, semiquavers,
demisemiquavers, and hemidemisemiquavers, respectively. The values may have
fractions, and negative values (indicating stem shortening) can be used, up to
a maximum shortening of 8 points. Unbeamed notes that are shorter than a
semiquaver need to have their stems lengthened in order to fit in the extra
tails. The default setting for this directive is:
.code
stemlengths 0 0 0 0 2 4
.endd
This specifies stem lengthening for demisemiquavers and hemidemisemiquavers of
2 and 4 points, respectively. Note that these values do not apply to beamed
notes; however, the stem lengths of individual notes in a beam can be adjusted
(&R; &<<SUBSECTnoteexpr>>&, &<<SUBSECTstemlengths>>&).



.subsection "Stemswap" SUBSECTstemswap
.index "&%stemswap%&"
.index "stems" "direction"
.index "notes" "stem direction"
.index "direction of stems"
.index "changing stem rules"
This directive is used to alter the way in which PMW chooses stem directions
for notes lying on the stem swap level for the stave. Specifying this directive
has the effect of altering rules N5 and N6 as described in section
&<<SECTstemdir>>& (&'Stem directions'&). Note that rule N3 is &'not'& affected.
.code
stemswap up
.endd
All notes at the stem swap level that are not otherwise constrained have stems
that go upwards. This can be useful when there is vocal underlay.
.code
stemswap down
.endd
This gives the opposite effect, and may be useful for American publishers.
.code
stemswap left
.endd
The direction of the stem of a note on the stem swap level depends on the stem
direction of the note to its left, viewing the part as one long stave (in other
words, it depends on the previous note). If the previous note is a breve or
semibreve, a notional stem direction is computed as if it were a shorter note.
.code
stemswap right
.endd
This makes the stem direction depend on the next note to the right that is not
also on the stem swap level. However, the search for the next note does not
extend beyond the end of the bar. If the final note(s) of a bar are on the stem
swap level, their stem direction is taken from the preceding note.



.subsection "Stemswaplevel" SUBSECTstemswaplevel
.index "&%stemswaplevel%&"
.index "stems" "direction"
.index "notes" "stem direction"
This directive specifies, for each stave, the level at which stems normally
swap from pointing down to pointing up. The default value is zero, which
specifies the middle line of the stave. On the swap level itself, the stem may
go either up or down, depending on the surrounding notes and the option set by
&%stemswap%& or defaulted. Like &%stavespacing%&, if &%stemswaplevel%& is
followed by a single number, this sets the level for all staves to that value.
After such a single number (which is optional), further pairs of numbers
separated by slashes can be given to set different levels for individual
staves. The swap level value may be positive or negative, and its units are
note positions.
.code
stemswaplevel 1/1 2/-1
.endd
This example requests that on stave 1, the swap level is moved to the third
space instead of the third line, and on the second stave it is moved down to
the second space. For all other staves the value is unchanged.



.subsection "Suspend" SUBSECTheadsuspend
.index "&%suspend%&"
.index "suspending staves"
This directive affects only the movement in which it appears. It specifies the
suspension of certain staves from the beginning of the movement. It must be
followed by a list of staves, in the same format as the &%bracket%& and
&%brace%& directives.
.code
suspend 1,3,5-9
.endd
A detailed description of the suspension mechanism is given in the section on
the stave directive of the same name (&R; &<<SUBSECTsuspend>>&).



.subsection "Systemgap"
.index "&%systemgap%&"
.index "system gap"
.index "spacing" "systems"
.index "gaps" "between systems"
The vertical distance between systems is measured from the bottom of the last
stave of one system to the bottom of the first stave of the next system, and
this distance can be specified by &%systemgap%&, which takes a single dimension
as its argument. Whatever is set for one movement carries over as the default
for the next movement. The initial default is 44 points, the same as the
default spacing between staves in a system. Thus, by default, the entire output
on a page is on evenly spaced staves when there is no vertical justification.
When vertical justification is happening (&R; &<<SUBSECTjustify>>&), the system
gap is a minimum distance between systems; once the page layout is determined,
the gaps are expanded so that the last stave of the last system on a page is
exactly at the bottom of the page. The spacing between systems can be varied in
the middle of a piece. See the stave directives &%[sghere]%&, &%[sgnext]%&, and
&%[sgabove]%& in section &<<SUBSECTsg>>&.



.subsection "Systemseparator" SUBSECTsystemseparator
.index "&%Systemseparator%&"
.index "system separator"
.index "system divider"
This directive configures separating marks between systems, also known as
system dividers, as shown in the following example:

.music "music66" 100 12,-14

The directive has up to five arguments. Only the first is mandatory, and it
specifies the length of the separator lines. Setting it to zero (the default)
turns off separators. A value of 16 is used in the example above. The complete
set of arguments is:
.display
&`systemseparator`& <&'length'&> <&'width'&> <&'angle'&> <&'x-adjust'&> <&'y-adjust'&>
.endd
The default width is 2 and the default angle is 20 (degrees). The lines are by
default positioned with their lefthand end aligned with the start of the
system, at a fixed position above it. The last two arguments, which may be
positive or negative, adjust this position.
.code
systemseparator 20 2.1 25 -16 -2
.endd
This example specifes slightly longer, thicker, and more angled lines, moved
leftwards and downwards. Separator lines are not output before the first system
on a page, the first system of a new movement if it has any heading lines, or
any system that contains only one stave.



.subsection "Textfont" SUBSECTtextfont
.index "&%textfont%&"
.index "fonts" "additional"
.index "additional fonts"
This directive is permitted only in the first movement. By default, all text
strings use the &'Times'& series of fonts. This directive can be used to
specify alternative fonts and also to define up to twelve additional fonts. It
takes the following form:
.display
&`textfont`& <&'fontword'&> "<&'full font name'&>"
.endd
The first argument must be one of the words `roman', `italic', `bold',
`bolditalic', `symbol', or `extra' followed by a number in the range 1&--12,
specifying which text font is being defined. The final argument is the full
name of the font, in double quotes.
.code
textfont bold "Palatino-Bold"
.endd
This example changes the bold face font from the default (which is
&'Times-Bold'&) to &'Palatino-Bold'&. An example that defines the first of the
twelve available extra fonts is:
.code
textfont extra 1 "Helvetica"
.endd
This font is accessed in text strings by the escape sequence &`\xx1\`&. See
section &<<SUBSECTfontchanges>>& for details of font-changing escape sequences.
The capitalization of font names is important.

.index "fonts" "including in output"
The &%textfont%& directive has a third, optional argument that can be given
immediately before the font name. It is the word `include', for example:
.code
textfont extra 1 include "FancyFont"
.endd
If `include' is present, PMW searches for a font file to include in PostScript
output. The file name must be the font name with the extension &`.pfa`&, and
the file must be in one of the directories that is searched for font files (see
the &%-F%& command line option). Note that the &%-incPMWfont%& command line
option and the &%incPMWfont%& directive apply only to PMW's music fonts. When
output is in PDF format, `include' has no effect because non-standard fonts are
always included in the output.



.subsection "Textsizes" SUBSECTtextsizes
.index "&%textsizes%&"
.index "text" "sizes"
.index "figured bass" "size"
.index "underlay" "size"
.index "size" "of text"
Text that is specified with music on a stave can be output in twenty different
settable sizes in addition to the default sizes for underlay, overlay, and
figured bass text. The &%textsizes%& directive specifies the sizes that are
required. It is followed by up to twenty font sizes, which may include
stretching factors and shear angles. Any unspecified sizes are set to 10
points.
.code
textsizes 10.5 11 7.6 9/1.1
.endd
By default, ordinary text is output using the first size specified, but
underlay, overlay, and figured bass text uses the size specified by the
&%underlaysize%&, &%overlaysize%&, or &%fbsize%& header directives,
respectively. To output text at any of the other settable sizes, the &`/s`&
qualifier must be used. There are also 10 fixed sizes that can be selected by
the &`/S`& qualifier (&R; &<<SUBSECTtextsizeoption>>&).



.subsection "Thinbracket"
.index "&%thinbracket%&"
.index "bracket, thin"
.index "joining signs"
.index "staves" "joining signs"
This directive, which has the same syntax as &%bracket%& and &%brace%&, causes
a thin square bracket to be drawn to join two or more staves. Like &%brace%&,
nothing is drawn if it covers only one stave, and it is drawn outside the
thicker bracket, if that is present. This sign is sometimes used in scores to
join staves containing multiple parts for the same instrument.



.subsection "Time"
.index "&%time%&"
.index "time signatures" "specifying"
This directive applies only to the movement in which it appears. It sets a time
signature for all the staves of the movement. Changes can be made during the
music or for individual staves, which are permitted to have different time
signatures. See the &%[time]%& directive for details. The default time
signature is 4/4.



.subsection "Timebase"
.index "&%timebase%&"
This directive can be used at the start of a new movement to cancel the effect
of &%notimebase%& in the previous movement.



.subsection "Timefont" SUBSECTtimefont
.index "&%timefont%&"
.index "fonts" "for time signatures"
.index "time signatures" "selecting font"
The &%timefont%& directive is used to specify the font for time signatures. Its
syntax is:
.display
&`timefont`& <&'size'&> <&'name'&>
.endd
The name must be one of the words `roman', `italic', `bold', or `bolditalic',
or the word `extra' followed by a number in the range 1&--12. It cannot be
omitted. When this directive is not used, an 11.8-point bold font is used for
time signatures. The parameters set by &%timefont%& do not affect the time
signatures C and A &-- they affect only numeric time signatures, or those
output via the &%printtime%& directive. Changing the size of the time signature
font does not affect the positioning of the characters. The facility is
intended for selecting a suitable size when a font other than &'Times-Bold'& is
used.




.subsection "Timewarn"
.index "&%timewarn%&"
This directive can be used at the start of a new movement to cancel the effect
of &%notimewarn%& in the previous movement.



.subsection "Topmargin"
See section &<<SUBSECTbottommargin>>& (&'Bottommargin and topmargin'&) above.



.subsection "Transpose"
.index "&%transpose%&"
.index "transposition"
This directive applies only to the movement in which it appears. It sets a
transposition for the whole movement, and  must be followed by a positive or
negative number specifying the number of semitones of transposition up or
down, respectively. If a transposition is also specified from the command line,
the two values are added together. Section &<<SECTtransposition>>& gives more
details about transposition.



.subsection "Transposedacc"
.index "&%transposedacc%&"
.index "accidentals" "in transposed staves"
.index "transposition" "control of accidentals"
By default, unless the stave has the pseudo-key N set, PMW always outputs an
accidental on a transposed note if an accidental is present on the original,
thereby preserving cautionary accidentals. If &%transposedacc%& is followed by
the word `noforce', it changes this behaviour such that accidentals are shown
only when strictly necessary. The standard behaviour can be reinstated for
subsequent movements by specifying `force'. There is also a &%[transposedacc]%&
stave directive that can alter the behaviour within a single stave. It is
possible to force either behaviour for individual notes (&R;
&<<SUBSECTtransposedaccidentals>>&). For the special treatment of the
pseudo-key N, see section &<<SUBSECTtransposeN>>&.



.subsection "Transposedkey"
.index "&%transposedkey%&"
.index "transposition" "control of keys"
.index "key signatures" "after transposition"
When there is a choice of standard key signature after transposition, PMW uses
a fixed default. For example, it uses the key of G&flat; rather than F&sharp;.
There is a complete list of the relevant key signatures in section
&<<SECTtransposition>>&. This list also applies when key or chord names in
strings are being transposed. The default can be overridden by specifying:
.display
&`transposedkey`& <&'key1'&> &`use`& <&'key2'&>
.endd
This means `if transposing a key signature yields <&'key1'&>, use <&'key2'&>
instead'.
.code
transposedkey G$ use F#
.endd
This example ensures transposition into F&sharp; instead of G&flat;. A
transposition of zero is different to no transposition at all, and if it is
specified, any settings of &%transposedkey%& are consulted. This makes it easy
to process the same piece of music with or without a key signature. The
&%transposedkey%& directive has other uses when transposing music that is
notated using the 18th century convention of fewer accidentals in the key
signature than in the tonality. It makes it possible to format the transposed
music either with a modern key signature, or using the same convention.



.subsection "Trillstring"
.index "&%trillstring%&"
.index "trill" "choice of string"
When a trill is indicated for a note, the glyph &{&#136;}& from the music font
is used by default. The &%trillstring%& directive lets you change this for
another character or characters.
.code
trillstring "\it\tr"
.endd
This example replaces &{&#136;}& by the letters &'tr'& in italic. The string
may be preceded by a number, specifying the size of font to be used. The
default size is 10 points.


.subsection "Tripletfont"
.index "&%tripletfont%&"
.index "fonts" "for triplets"
This directive is a synonym for &%tupletfont%&.


.subsection "Tripletlinewidth"
.index "&%tripletlinewidth%&"
.index "line width for triplets"
This directive is a synonym for &%tupletlinewidth%&.


.subsection "Tupletfont" SUBSECTtupletfont
.index "&%tupletfont%&"
.index "fonts" "for tuplets"
.index "irregular note groups" "font for number"
This directive specifies the size and style of the text font used for the `3'
over triplets, and also similar numbers over other irregular note groups
(tuplets). The syntax is:
.display
&`tupletfont`& <&'fontsize'&> <&'name'&>
.endd
The size is a number giving the font size (with an optional stretching factor
and shearing angle). If it is omitted, a size of 10 points is used. The name
must be one of the standard font name words such as `bolditalic' (&R;
&<<SECTtextfonts>>&). It cannot be omitted. When this directive is not used, a
10-point roman font is used for tuplet numbers.



.subsection "Tupletlinewidth" SUBSECTtupletlinewidth
.index "&%tupletlinewidth%&"
.index "line width for tuplets"
This directive sets the width of lines used for the horizontal brackets of
irregular note groups. The default width is 0.3 points.



.subsection "Underlaydepth"
.index "&%underlaydepth%&"
.index "underlay" "line depth"
If two or more character strings, all designated as underlay, are attached to
the same note, they are automatically placed one below the other. The distance
between the baselines of the strings can be set by this directive. The default
depth is 11 points. A negative argument can be given to this directive for
special effects, such as alternative words above a stave. However, this is
probably easier to achieve using the overlay facilities. The depth parameters
for underlaid and overlaid text are separate and independent.



.subsection "Underlayextenders"
.index "&%underlayextenders%&"
This directive restores extender lines at the ends of underlay words whose last
syllable extends over more than one note if they were suppressed by
&%nounderlayextenders%& in an earlier movement.



.subsection "Underlaysize"
.index "&%underlaysize%&"
.index "underlay" "size"
By default, text that is specified as being vocal underlay is output using a
10-point font. This directive enables a different size to be chosen for
underlaid text.
.code
underlaysize 9.5
.endd
Individual items of underlay text can be output at different sizes by using
the &`/s`& or &`/S`& text qualifier. The size parameters for underlaid and
overlaid text are separate and independent.



.subsection "Underlaystyle" SUBSECTunderlaystyle
.index "&%underlaystyle%&"
.index "underlay" "multiple notes per syllable"
.index "underlay" "alignment"
.index "alignment of underlay"
By default, PMW centres underlay and overlay syllables under or over each note,
respectively. There is a tradition, `now frequently ignored' (Kurt Stone,
&'Music Notation in the Twentieth Century'&), that calls for multinote
syllables to be aligned flush left with the initial note. The &%underlaystyle%&
directive is used to request PMW to align underlay and overlay in this
traditional manner. Its argument is a number: style 0 is the default, and style
1 sets multinote syllables flush left. When operating in style 1, individual
multinote syllables can be centred by making use of the ^ character (&R;
&<<SUBSECTunderlayspacing>>&), which is still recognized in this style. In
effect, style 1 causes the automatic insertion of a ^ character at the start of
any multinote syllable that does not already contain one.



.subsection "Unfinished" SUBSECTunfinished
.index "&%unfinished%&"
.index "solid bar line"
.index "bar lines" "at end of piece"
This directive, which has no arguments, applies only to the movement in which
it appears. It indicates that the music data supplied is not a complete
movement. This has the effect of suppressing the solid bar line at the end. It
is not necessary to specify &%unfinished%& if the movement ends with a double
bar line.



.subsection "Vertaccsize"
.index "&%vertaccsize%&"
.index "accidentals" "size when above"
.index "size" "of accidentals above notes"
The size of accidentals that are placed above or below notes (&R;
&<<SUBSECTaccabovebelow>>&) is controlled by this header directive; the
default size is 10 points, which causes them to be the same size as normal
accidentals.
.code
vertaccsize 9
.endd
This example causes them to be slightly smaller than the default.

.index-to I04

.tocsubsecton
.chapter "Stave data" CHAPstavedata
.index-from I06 "stave data"
This is the first of two chapters that describe the format of the data for a
single stave, which consists of a sequence of notes and rests, interspersed
with other items such as bar lines, key and time signatures, clefs, text
strings, etc. The items that are not notes or rests are as follows:
.ilist
A few common items that can conveniently be represented in the computer's
character set are represented by one or more special characters. An example is
the use of the vertical bar to indicate a bar line. These items are described
in the next few sections.
.next
Textual items, such as &*&'f'&*&, &'a tempo'&, etc., are coded as strings
enclosed in double-quote characters, and are described in section
&<<SECTtextitems>>&.
.next
.index "stave directives"
Other non-note items take the form of &'stave directives'&, enclosed in square
brackets. There are several different formats for stave directives. They are
described in alphabetical order in section &<<SECTstavedirectives>>&.
.endlist

Notes, rests and other items may be interspersed freely, as required.
.index "space character"
Space characters and line breaks can be used to separate items, in order to
make the input easier to read, though they are not necessary except to avoid
ambiguity . PMW makes no attempt to check on the musical sense of what it is
asked to typeset, other than to check bar lengths.
.index "bar lengths"
When there is more than one stave, the length of the notes in each bar must be
the same for all staves, though it is possible to handle some special cases
such as a 2/4 stave and a 6/8 stave in the same system (&R;
&<<SUBSECTstadiffsig>>&). The length of the notes in a bar must agree with the
time signature, unless &%nocheck%& or &%[nocheck]%& has been used (&R;
&<<SECTbarlennum>>&).


.section "Bar lines"
.index "bar lines" "single and double"
.index "double bar lines" "specifying"
Bar lines in the music are indicated by means of the vertical bar character. A
single vertical bar gives a single bar line; two successive vertical bars
without any intervening space characters gives a double bar line.
.index "bar lines" "end-style in mid-piece"
Unless the final bar ends with a double bar line or the &%unfinished%&
directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTunfinished>>&) is used, the end of a piece or movement
is marked in the traditional manner with a thin bar line followed by a thick
bar line. Occasionally such a bar line may be needed in the middle of a piece.
This is notated by three vertical bars in succession.
.index "bar lines" "empty bar"
.index "empty bar"
To encode a totally empty bar it is necessary to include at least one space
between two vertical bar characters. The amount of horizontal space that is
inserted after a bar line is controlled by the &%barlinespace%& directive.

.index "bar lines" "styles"
There are six different styles for single barlines (&R;
&<<SUBSECTbarlinestyle>>&). The default style can be set by &%barlinestyle%&
(for the whole piece) or &%[barlinestyle]%& (for an individual stave). In
addition, the style of any individual bar line may be specified by following
the vertical bar character with a digit in the range 0&--5. Note that the
&%breakbarlines%& directive can be used to specify breaks in bar lines at
particular staves. This overall setting can be overridden for individual bars
by using the &%[breakbarline]%& or &%[unbreakbarline]%& stave directives.

Normally, the end of a bar marks the end of a set of beamed notes. If a bar
line encoding is followed by an equals sign, any existing beam is carried over
the bar line and into the next bar if it starts with a suitable note (&R;
&<<SUBSECTbeamoverbar>>&). This applies all forms of bar line, including
invisible bar lines.


.subsection "Invisible bar lines" SUBSECTinvisbar
.index "bar lines" "dummy"
.index "bar lines" "invisible"
.index "invisible items" "bar lines"
Occasionally it may be necessary to put in a dummy bar line in order to allow
PMW to start a new system in the middle of a bar &-- something it does not
normally do. If a vertical bar character in the input is immediately followed
by a question mark, it behaves exactly as a normal bar line, except that
nothing is output. The &%barlinespace%& directive, which controls the amount
of space that is inserted after a bar line, also applies to invisible bar
lines. Usually, the bars on either side of an invisible bar line are
of abnormal length, so you need to turn off the bar length check for
each of them (using &%[nocheck]%&), and if bar numbers are being shown, the
&%[nocount]%& stave directive should be used to stop one of them from being
counted.


.subsection "Mid-bar dotted bar lines"
.index "bar lines" "dotted"
.index "dotted bar lines"
The character &`:`& (colon) may appear on its own in the middle of a bar. It
causes a dotted bar line to appear at that point. The bar line is subject to
the normal controls for whether it extends down to the next stave or not. A
colon does not end the bar.



.section "Repeated bars or part bars" SECTrepeatbars
.index "repeated bars"
.index "repeat bar sign"
.index "bars" "repeated"
.index "repetition" "single bars"
A bar containing the conventional `repeat previous bar' sign &{&#144;&#143;}&&~
can be coded using a special form of whole bar rest (&R;&<<SUBSECTrests>>&). If
you want to duplicate a sequence of bars, or a fragment of a bar, you can
arrange this via the string repetition feature (&R;
&<<SUBSECTstringrepetition>>&), which replicates an arbitrary sequence of input
characters at preprocessing time.

For repeating a single, complete bar there is a simpler shortcut mechanism. The
appearance of a number enclosed in square brackets causes those items to the
right of it in the current bar, including the bar line, to be repeated that
number of times. This facility is most commonly used for
.index "rests" "repeated bars"
.index "repeated rest bars"
.index "many bars rest"
sequences of rest bars, but it can be used with any bar.
.code
[45] R! | [key C] [10] R! |
.endd
In the second repetition, the key signature is included in the first bar only.
If it had followed &`[10]`& it would have been included in all ten bars. Within
any string that is part of a bar that is repeated in this way, the escape
sequence &`\r\`& is replaced by the repetition number. Thus, to number a
sequence of rest bars, centring the number over the rest sign, coding like this
can be used:
.code
[10] "\r\"/a/c R! |
.endd
You can also use &`\r2\`&, which does the same thing, but starting at the
second bar; nothing is inserted in the first repeated bar. This makes it
possible to put something different on the first bar. Note the use of &`/cb`&
in the next example to centre each text string in its bar. See section
&<<SECTtextitems>>& for details of string options.

.code
 "1-6"/a/cb [6] "\r2\"/a/cb f-x3 |
.endd

.music "music64" 36 0,-20

There is danger of confusion between repeated bars and rehearsal marks.
Accidental omission of the quotes from a numerical rehearsal mark such as
&`["42"]`& can lead to some very strange effects. There is more discussion of
repeated rest bars in the section entitled &'Repeated rest bars'& (&R;
&<<SUBSECTreprest>>&).

&*Warning:*& This bar-repeating mechanism should not be used with
multi-syllable underlay texts, because the syllables are apportioned to notes
as they are read from the input, and bars that are repeated in this way are not
re-read. The string repetition facility, however, can be used in this
situation.



.section "Repeated sections"
.index "repeat marks"
The beginnings and ends of repeated sections of music are marked by the
following character sequences:

.itable none 0 0 2  16 left  200 left
.row &`(:`&  "for the start of a repeated section"
.row &`:)`&  "for the end of a repeated section"
.endtable

These need not be at the beginning or end of a bar, though if they are, the
repetition sign is amalgamated with the bar line in the conventional manner.
Several different styles of repeat mark are provided (&R;
&<<SUBSECTrepeatstyle>>&). First and second time bars are catered for (&R;
&<<SUBSECTfirstsecond>>&). PMW does not normally end lines of music other than
at the ends of bars. If a repeat occurs in the middle of a bar and you want to
allow that bar to be split over a line break, you have to use an `invisible bar
line' (&R; &<<SUBSECTinvisbar>>&). PMW makes no check that the repetition signs
make musical sense. When a bar starts with a new time signature and a repeat
mark, the order in which these are shown depends on the order in which they
appear in the input.
.code
[time 4/4] (:
.endd
This example causes the time signature to be first, followed by the
repeat mark.
.code
(: [time 4/4]
.endd
This example causes the repeat mark to be amalgamated with the previous bar
line, with the time signature following. If, at the same point in the music,
these items appear in different orders on different staves, the repeat sign is
first on all staves.



.section "Caesuras"
.index "caesuras"
.index "pause" "caesura"
A caesura (pause) in the music is encoded in the input in very much the way it
appears on the stave.
.code
c'B // r-c'- |
.endd
A caesura is normally shown as two sloping strokes through the top of the
stave, but the &%caesurastyle%& directive can be used to obtain a single-stroke
version, though the input must still be two slashes.



.section "Hairpins" SECThairpins
.index "hairpins"
.index "crescendo mark"
.index "diminuendo mark"
The characters &`>`& and &`<`& are used within a stave to encode hairpins
(crescendo and diminuendo marks, sometimes called `wedges'). They are always
used in pairs, and they enclose the set of notes above or below which the
hairpin is to be drawn.
.code
a b > c d e >
.endd
This example specifies a diminuendo hairpin that extends under the three notes
C, D, and E. Unterminated hairpins are automatically terminated at the start of
a hairpin of the opposite kind. If the end of a hairpin is given at the start
of a bar, before the first note, the hairpin is terminated just past the bar
line, unless it is the first bar of a line, when it is extended far enough to
be of reasonable size. (See also the &`/bar`& option below.)

A minimum length of 10 points is imposed on hairpins. If a hairpin would be
shorter than 10 points, it is extended on the right until it is 10 points long.
As well as the case of a hairpin terminating at the start of a system, this can
also happen if a hairpin is specified with only a single note between the angle
brackets. Hairpins can extend over bar boundaries; if a hairpin extends over
the end of a system, it is terminated, and a fresh one started on the next
system. The end of the first part of a diminuendo or the start of the
continuation of a crescendo is drawn with a small gap to indicate the
continuation.


.subsection "Horizontal hairpin positioning"
By default, a hairpin starts at the left-hand edge of the first enclosed note,
and ends at the right-hand edge of the last enclosed note, but there are
options to change this. The start or the end of a hairpin can be set to be
halfway between the relevant note and the one that follows it, or the end of
the bar, by means of the &`/h`& option.
.code
>/h GAB >/h B
.endd
This example starts the hairpin halfway between G and A, and ends it halfway
between the two Bs. Without &`/h`&, it would have started just before the G and
ended just after the first B. The &`/h`& option always moves the start or end
to the right, never to the left. The halfway distance is just a default; the
option can be used more generally by following it with a number indicating the
fraction of the distance that is required.
.code
< GGG </h0.8 |
.endd
This example ends the hairpin 0.8 of the way between the last note and the bar
line. Another option that adjusts the horizontal position of hairpins is
&`/bar`&. If the character indicating the start of a hairpin is followed by
&`/bar`&, the hairpin starts at the horizontal position of the previous bar
line, except at the start of a system, where it starts after the clef and key
signature. If the character indicating the end of a hairpin is followed by
&`/bar`&, the hairpin ends at the next bar line. The use of &`/bar`& overrides
&`/h`&.

.index "MusicXML" "offset positioning (hairpin)"
Another way of specifying horizontal position is to use &`/lc`& or &`/rc`&
followed by a number that may have a fractional part. This specifies a left or
right movement by a number of crotchets, thereby positioning the hairpin with
respect to the musical offset in the bar. This is similar to the `offset'
positioning that is used in MusicXML. An offset value is used only if neither
&`/h`& nor &`/bar`& is present.


.subsection "Horizontal hairpin adjustments"
The hairpin characters can be followed by &`/l`& or &`/r`&, followed by a
number, to move left or right from where the hairpin would otherwise appear.
These qualifiers affect only the end of the hairpin at which they are
specified.
.code
</l5 a b c d </r5
.endd
This example stretches the hairpin horizontally by 5 points at each end. If
&`/l`& or &`/r`& are given as well as &`/h`&, &`/bar`&, &`/lc`&, or &`/rc`&,
the effect is cumulative.


.subsection "Vertical hairpin positioning"
Hairpins are positioned under the stave by default, but the &%[hairpins]%&
directive (&R; &<<SUBSECThairpinsstave>>&) can be used to place them above
instead. When a hairpin's vertical position is not explicitly specified, it is
determined by the notes under or above which it lies. However, the
&%[hairpins]%& directive can also specify a fixed distance above or below the
stave, or a general vertical adjustment for all hairpins.

Individual hairpins can be forced to be above the stave, below the stave, or in
the middle between the current stave and the one below, by means of the options
&`/a`&, &`/b`&, and &`/m`&. Do not confuse &`/m`& with &`/h`&. One way of
remembering the difference is to associate &`/h`& with `horizontal' rather than
`halfway'. A fixed level above or below the stave can be specified by following
&`/a`& or &`/b`& by a dimension.
.code
>/a10 bc'eb > |  </b12 gfag < |
.endd
This example positions the hairpins with their `sharp end' 10 points above the
top of the stave and twelve points below the bottom of the stave, respectively.


.subsection "Vertical hairpin adjustments"
The hairpin characters can be followed by &`/u`& or &`/d`&, followed by a
number, to move up or down from where the hairpin would otherwise appear. If
&`/u`& or &`/d`& is given at the start of a hairpin, it causes the whole
hairpin to be moved up or down.
.code
a b </d4 c d <
.endd
This example outputs a hairpin that is 4 points lower than the default
position. If &`/u`& or &`/d`& are used at the end of a hairpin, they cause the
end to be moved up or down relative to the start.
.code
< abc </u10
.endd
This example specifies a crescendo hairpin that slopes upwards to the right.
Adding &`/u`& or &`/d`& to the left-hand end would move the whole hairpin up or
down, without affecting the angle of slope.


.subsection "Split hairpins"
If a hairpin is split over a line break, specifying &`/u`& or &`/d`& at its
start moves both halves of the hairpin up or down, but specifying one of them
on the final angle bracket moves just the final end point, as for non-split
hairpins. The vertical positions of the intermediate ends of split hairpins can
be controlled by the options &`/slu`&, &`/sld`&, &`/sru`&, and &`/srd`&. They
must be given on the starting angle bracket of a hairpin. The rather confusing
abbreviations `sl' and `sr' stand for `split left' and `split right'. They
refer to the two ends of the split as they would be on one long system before
it is split up. Thus, `sl' refers to the right-hand end of the first part of
a split hairpin, whereas `sr' refers to the left-hand end of the second part.
To move the second part of a hairpin down by 10 points, you would use
&`/srd10`& on the starting angle bracket, and &`/d10`& on the final bracket.


.subsection "Hairpin size and line thickness" SUBSECThairpinwidth
The width of the open end of an individual hairpin can be set by following the
initial &`<`& or &`>`& character with &`/w`& and a dimension.
.code
</w4 ga <
.endd
This example sets a width of 4 points. The default is 7 points, but this can be
changed by the &%hairpinwidth%& header directive (for the whole piece) or by
the &%[hairpinwidth]%& directive (for the current stave). There is also a
&%hairpinlinewidth%& directive, which is used to change the thickness of the
lines used for drawing hairpins. The default thickness is 0.2 points.



.section "Notes and rests"
.index "notes" "specifying"
.index "rests"
The information for a note consists of five parts, of which only the first two
are mandatory. The parts are, in order: pitch, length, expression and/or
options, tie or slur information, and beam break information. A rest has only a
length and an options part. Notes and rests do not have to be separated by
spaces, though spaces can be inserted to improve the readability. A sequence
such as &`abcd`& is perfectly valid input for four notes. Spaces may not,
however, appear within the encoding for a single note, except in the options
part as specified below.


.subsection "Note pitch"
.index "notes" "pitch"
.index "pitch of note"
.index "note letters"
The pitch of a note is indicated by one of the usual note-letters, A to G. As
is conventional in music, by default the letters represent the notes C to B in
the octave below middle C (octave 0). The case of the letter (upper case or
lower case, that is, capital or small letter) does &'not'&, however, form part
of the pitch information (contrary to musical convention). Instead it is used
to indicate the note length, as described below (&R;
&<<SUBSECTlengthnotesrests>>&).

The default octave for notes can be changed by means of the &%[octave]%& stave
directive (&R; &<<SUBSECToctave>>&) or when a clef is specified (&R;
&<<SECTclef>>&). Each octave setting replaces the previous one; they are not
cumulative. The setting can a positive or a negative number:
.display
&`[octave -1]    `& C is the note two octaves below middle C
&`[octave 0]     `& C is the note one octave below middle C
&`[octave 1]     `& C is middle C
.endd
PMW supports 8 octaves, from -3 to +4. A note's pitch is raised one octave
above the default by following the letter by a single quote character
(apostrophe); two octaves require two quotes, and so on. Similarly, a note's
pitch is lowered one octave by following the letter by a grave accent
character.

.index "accidentals" "specifying"
Accidentals are indicated by special characters before the note letter. The
sharp character is the obvious one to use for indicating a sharp sign, but
there are no obvious candidates for flats or naturals. Therefore two keys that
are adjacent on most keyboards, and next to the sharp sign on some, are used:
the dollar sign for flat and the percent sign for natural. Double sharps and
double flats are indicated by two sharp signs or two dollars. Here are some
examples of notes of different pitches, when the octave is set at 0 (the
default):
.itable none 0 0 2  40 left  300 left
.row &`c'`&     "middle C"
.row &`C''`&    "the C above middle C"
.row &`#g`&     "G sharp below middle C"
.row &`$b'`&    "B flat above middle C"
.row &`%c`&     "C natural below middle C"
.row &`##g``&   "G double sharp, below the C below middle C"
.endtable


.subsection "Half accidentals" SUBSECThalfaccs
.index "accidentals" "half sharps and flats"
.index "sharp, half"
.index "half sharp"
.index "flat, half"
.index "half flat"
.index "MIDI" "half intervals"
Two different symbols for half sharps and half flats are provided in the
PMW-Music font; the &%halfsharpstyle%& and &%halfflatstyle%& directives specify
which ones to use. A half sharp is notated as &`#-`& and a half flat as &`$-`&.

.music "music46" 32 0,-16

MIDI does not support half intervals; if a MIDI file is generated, these
accidentals are treated as full sharps or flats. A piece containing half
accidentals can be transposed. Custom key signatures containing half
accidentals are supported via the &%makekey%& directive (&R;
&<<SUBSECTmakekey>>&).


.subsection "Bracketted and parenthesized accidentals" SUBSECTbrackacc
.index "accidentals" "bracketed"
.index "accidentals" "parenthesized"
.index "parenthesized accidentals"
.index "bracketed accidentals"
Cautionary accidentals are sometimes put in round brackets (parentheses) or
square brackets. This is requested by following the accidental with a closing
bracket of the appropriate type, as in these examples:
.code
#)a   $]b   ##)c
.endd


.subsection "Invisible accidentals"
.index "invisible items" "accidentals"
.index "accidentals" "invisible"
When two or more parts are being overprinted on the same stave, certain
accidentals on one part are often omitted, because an accidental in another
part serves, in the visible music, for both. However, if a MIDI file is being
generated, the music does not sound correct when played. Invisible accidentals
are provided to change the note that is played, without causing anything to be
displayed. Following an accidental character with a question mark (for example,
&`#?g`&) causes it to become invisible. As for normal accidentals, the effect
of invisible accidentals lasts until the end of the bar. Invisible accidentals
may not be specified as parenthesized.


.subsection "Moved accidentals" SUBSECTmovedacc
.index "accidentals" "moved"
.index "moved accidentals"
Occasionally it is necessary to move an accidental sign to the left of where it
would normally be. If the character &`<`& follows the accidental, it is placed
5 points to the left of its normal position, scaled to the stave size. Two
successive &`<`& characters move 10 points left, and so on. Alternatively, a
number may follow the &`<`& character to specify exactly how far left to move
the accidental.
.itable none 0 0 2  60 left  200 left
.row &`#<A`&        "the sharp is moved left by 5 points"
.row &`$<<b`&       "the flat is moved left by 10 points"
.row &`%<4.25C`&    "the natural is moved left by 4.25 points"
.endtable


.subsection "Accidentals above and below notes" SUBSECTaccabovebelow
.index "accidentals" "above or below notes"
.index "notes" "accidentals above or below"
Some editors like to place editorial accidentals above or below notes. Text
strings can be used for this, but they do not transpose, and the music is not
played correctly if a MIDI file is generated. Instead, the letters &`o`& and
&`u`& should be used to request that an accidental be placed over or under the
note (the letters &`a`& and &`b`& cannot be used because they are note names).
.code
#oa $ub
.endd
This example puts a sharp above the note A, and a flat under the note B.
These accidentals affect the playing pitch of the note for MIDI output, but do
&'not'& affect subsequent notes in the bar. They change with transposition,
just as ordinary accidentals do. The size of these accidentals is controlled by
the header directive &%vertaccsize%&; the default size is 10 points, which
causes them to be the same size as normal accidentals. It is possible to move
them up or down by following &`o`& or &`u`& with &`/u`& or &`/d`& and a number.
(In fact, &`/l`& and &`/r`& are also available, though unlikely to be useful.)
.code
#o/u4c'  %u/d2f
.endd
If bracketed accidentals (&R; &<<SUBSECTbrackacc>>&) are required above or
below notes, the bracket must follow &`o`& or &`u`& and any up/down movement
specification.



.subsection "Transposed accidentals" SUBSECTtransposedaccidentals
.index "transposition" "accidentals"
.index "accidentals" "transposed"
.index "^ character" "with accidental"
.index "circumflex" "with accidental"
Normally, unless the stave is using the pseudo-key N, PMW outputs an accidental
sign for a transposed note if there is an accidental in the input, thus
preserving cautionary accidentals. The special handling for the pseudo-key N is
described in section &<<SUBSECTtransposeN>>&. For other keys, suppression of an
unnecessary accidental can be requested by following the accidental with
&`^-`&. If an accidental is actually necessary in the transposed music, it is
not suppressed. Suppression of unnecessary transposed accidentals can be
enabled for all notes by means of the &%transposedacc%& directive. When this is
done, individual accidentals can be put back by following the accidental with
&`^+`&. If a bracketed accidental is required, the bracket must follow the
transposition option, which in turn must follow any request to position the
accidental above or below the note.

PMW can be forced to choose an accidental for a transposed note in a particular
way (for example, with a double sharp instead of a natural). This facility is
provided for cases when the normal transposition rules are inappropriate, and
it is done by following the input accidental with one of the following
character sequences:
.itable none 0 0 2  30 left  300 left
.row &`^#`&     "use a sharp (`black' notes and C and F natural)"
.row &`^$`&     "use a flat (`black' notes and B and E natural)"
.row &`^##`&    "use a double sharp (`white' notes except C and F)"
.row &`^$$`&    "use a double flat (`white' notes except B and E)"
.row &`^%`&     "use a natural (all `white' notes)"
.endtable
For example, if a note that is specified as &`#^##G`& is transposed up by
one semitone, and would normally be shown as A-natural, it will now appear
as G-double-sharp.



.subsection "Rests" SUBSECTrests
.index "rests"
.index "rests" "invisible"
.index "rests" "whole bar"
.index "rhythm slash marks"
.index "slash rhythm mark"
.index "beat indicator sign"
.index "repeated bars"
.index "whole bar rests"
.index "invisible items" "rests"
.index "note letters"
.index "rests" "letters"
There are four `note letters' that are used instead of pitch letters to specify
rests of various kinds. For ease of remembering, they are adjacent in the
alphabet. The letter R is used to indicate a normal rest. It may not be
preceded by accidentals or followed by quote characters or grave accents. The
letter Q specifies a rest in the same way as R, but it causes nothing at all to
be output. It is an `invisible rest' that is useful for special effects when
overprinting staves or using coupled staves.

The letter S behaves like R except when it is used to specify a complete bar's
rest. Such bars are normally candidates for amalgamation with surrounding rest
bars, leading to the appearance of `long rest' bars where possible (&R;
&<<SUBSECTreprest>>&). When a rest bar is specified using S instead of R, it is
always output as an individual bar and never amalgamated. You can think of S
as standing for `single' or `separate'.

The letter T behaves like R except when it is used for a crotchet rest or a
whole bar's rest. In these cases it is a pseudo rest that is used as a way of
coding two special features. When T specifies a crotchet, instead of a rest
sign, a thick slash &{&#143;}&&~ is output. This mark is used to indicate a
beat without specifying a pitch (often because the part specifies chords by
means of chord symbols). When T is followed by an exclamation mark to indicate
a whole bar rest, the bar is never amalgamated with adjacent bars, and instead
of a rest sign, the conventional `repeat previous bar' sign
&{&#144;&#143;}&&~ is output. However, no sound is generated for MIDI output.



.subsection "Length of notes and rests" SUBSECTlengthnotesrests
.index "length" "of notes"
.index "length" "of rests"
.index "notes" "length"
.index "rests" "length"
The primary length of a note or rest (visible or invisible) is indicated by the
case of its letter. An upper case (capital) letter is used for a minim, and a
lower case (small) letter for a crotchet. The primary length is changed by the
addition of &`+`&, &`-`&, and &`=`& characters, which follow any
quotes or grave accents that adjust the note's octave, for example: &`C'+`&.
These characters can be freely mixed on any note, but &`+`& normally follows an
upper case letter whereas &`-`& and &`=`& normally follow a lower case letter.
The only restriction is the maximum and minimum supported note length (breve
and hemi-demi-semiquaver).

.index "breve" "specifying"
.index "flags"
.index "notes" "flags"
A plus character doubles the note's length. If used after an upper case letter
it gives a semibreve (one plus) or a breve (two plusses). A hyphen halves the
note length and an equals sign divides it by four. If used after a lower case
letter, the number of horizontal lines in these characters is equal to the
number of `flags' that are attached to the stem of the note. A minus sign is a
single flag for a quaver, an equals sign is two flags for a semiquaver, an
equals followed by a minus sign is three flags for a demi-semiquaver, and two
equals signs are four flags for a hemi-demi-semiquaver.

.index "&%[doublenotes]%&"
.index "&%doublenotes%&"
.index "doubling note lengths"
.index "notes" "doubling length"
.index "&%[halvenotes]%&"
.index "&%halvenotes%&"
.index "halving note lengths"
.index "notes" "halving length"
Some music contains long runs of quavers or semiquavers, which requires typing
minus or equals signs after every note letter by default. This can be avoided
by making use of the &%[halvenotes]%& stave directive (&R;
&<<SUBSECTstavehalvenotes>>&). Notes that follow this directive have their
length halved, so upper case letters are now crotchets and lower case letters
are quavers. The effect is cumulative, so using &%[halvenotes]%& twice turns
lower case letters into semiquavers. The effect can be reversed with
&%[doublenotes]%& (&R; &<<SUBSECTstavedoublenotes>>&). For example, these three
bars contain exactly the same notes:
.code
a-b-c-d-; a-b-c-d- |
[halvenotes] abcd; abcd |
[doublenotes] a-b-c-d-; a-b-c-d- |
.endd
There are also &%halvenotes%& and &%doublenotes%& header directives (&R;
&<<SUBSECThalvenotes>>&, &<<SUBSECTdoublenotes>>&), which cause every stave to
begin with halved or doubled notes, but these directives also affect time
signatures and are more useful for adjusting the overall format of a piece than
for minimizing typing.

.index "dotted notes"
.index "notes" "dotted"
One or two dots may follow a note or rest as in conventional music, to extend
its length by half and three-quarters, respectively. There is also support for
.index "Ghent, Emmanuel"
Emmanuel Ghent's notation for extending the length of a note by one
.index "plus after notes"
.index "notes" "followed by plus"
quarter (as reported in Gardner Read's book &'Music Notation'&). The PMW
encoding for this is to follow the note with a dot and then a plus sign. The
length of the note is extended by one quarter, and it is shown as the normal
note followed by a plus sign. This facility is particularly useful when there
are five beats in a bar.
.code
[time 5/4] A+.+
.endd
This example outputs a semibreve followed by a plus, indicating a note whose
length is equal to five crotchets. Here are some examples of notes and rests of
different lengths without any automatic halving or doubling:
.itable none 0 0 2  60 left 200 left
.row &`A++`&    "breve"
.row &`#B`+`&   "semibreve"
.row &`G+.+`&   "semibreve followed by plus"
.row &`F.`&     "dotted minim"
.row &`R`&      "minim rest"
.row &`e..`&    "double dotted crotchet"
.row &`$$g`&    "crotchet"
.row &`r-.`&    "dotted quaver"
.row &`c'-`&    "quaver"
.row &`d=`&     "semiquaver"
.row &`e''=-`&  "demi-semiquaver"
.row &`%b`==`&  "hemi-demi-semiquaver"
.endtable


.subsection "Chords"
.index "chords" "specifying"
PMW can deal with certain kinds of chord, notated by enclosing a number of
notes in parentheses. The notes must either all be of the same musical length,
or all but the first must consist of just a lower case letter, in which case
the length is taken from the first note.
.code
(gb)  (c'-#g'-)  (A++A'++)  (g=-bd'g')
.endd
The notes do not have to be in any particular pitch order. If there are to be
accents or ornaments on the chord (staccato, etc.), these must be specified on
the first note. Other note options that apply just to one note (for example,
notehead size or shape) can be on any note. A stem length adjustment is ignored
unless it is on the note nearest to the stem.
.index "beaming" "chords"

Chords consisting of quavers or shorter notes are beamed in the usual way (&R;
&<<SECTbeaming>>&); a semicolon after the closing parenthesis breaks all the
beaming, whereas a comma breaks secondary beams only.
.index "chords" "ties"
.index "ties" "chords"
If the chord is tied (&R; &<<SUBSECTshortslur>>&), the underline character that
indicates a tie must appear after the closing parenthesis and before any beam
break character. Note that an underline character cannot be used for a short
slur when chords are involved (as it can for single notes), because if two
chords are joined by an underscore, all the notes in each that are of the same
pitch are joined by a tie mark. The &%[slur]%& directive must be used to obtain
just a single slur mark.

.index "accidentals" "moved"
.index "moved accidentals"
.index "accidentals" "on chords"
.index "chords" "accidentals"
PMW automatically positions accidentals on chords unless one or more notes in
the chord contains an explicit accidental positioning request (&R;
&<<SUBSECTmovedacc>>&). In this case, no automatic positioning is done; it is
assumed that the user has positioned all the accidentals in the chord by hand.


.subsection "Horizontal movement of augmentation dots"
.index "augmentation dots" "moving horizontally"
.index "moved augmentation dots"
.index "dotted notes" "moving dots horizontally"
It is occasionally necessary to move augmentation dots to the right, usually
for multiple parts on the same stave with notes close together. If an
augmentation dot is preceded by the character &`>`& it is moved right by 5
points (scaled to the stave size). A different distance can be specified by
preceding the &`>`& with a dimension.
.code
a>.   g6.2>..
.endd
In this example, the dot after the A is moved 5 points to the right and the
double-dot after the g is moved 6.2 points. In a chord, the &`>`& character
must be used on the first note, and not on any others. It affects all the dots
in the chord, because they are always vertically aligned.


.subsection "Vertical position of augmentation dots" SUBSECTdotvert
.index "augmentation dots" "vertical position"
.index "dotted notes" "vertical position of dots"
.index "notes" "movement of dots"
The vertical position of dots for notes on lines can be controlled by the
&%[dots]%& directive and the &`\:\`& note option (&R; &<<SUBSECTnoteexpr>>&).
This option affects only notes that lie on stave lines. Normally dots for such
notes are placed in the stave space above, but if the colon option is present,
they are placed instead in the space below. The default position can be
changed by means of the &%[dots]%& stave directive; when the default is below,
the colon item causes the dot for a particular note to be placed above.
.code
[treble]     e.\:\     @ dot below
[dots below] g..\:\    @ dot above
.endd
The colon option can be used for individual notes within a chord. However, PMW
overrides the dot position setting when an interval of a second occurs in a
chord. In this case, the lower note, if it is on a line, always has its dot
below, and the upper note, if it is on a line, always has its dot above.
The &`\:\`& option does not affect notes in spaces, but it is sometimes
useful to be able to move their augmentation dots into the space above. The
option &`\::\`& achieves this; it has no effect if used on a note that lies on
a line. For example, the chord &`(e.g.a.)`& in the treble clef is shown by
default with only two dots. If three dots are required, there are two ways in
which this can be achieved:
.code
(e.\:\g.a.)  (e.g.a.\::\)
.endd
The first moves the dot on the lowest note down, and the second moves the dot
on the highest note up. When there is an interval of a second in a chord and
the higher note has its dot moved up by this means, the lower note's dot is no
longer automatically moved down.


.subsection "Notehead shapes and sizes" SUBSECTnoteheads
.index "noteheads" "size of"
The shape of noteheads is controlled by the &%[noteheads]%& directive (&R;
&<<SUBSECTnoteheadstave>>&). Smaller than normal noteheads are used for grace
notes, and for notes that appear between &%[cue]%& and &%[endcue]%&. In these
cases, the entire note (head and stem) is output at a smaller size. You can
also request a small (cue-sized) notehead, without affecting any other part of
the note, by means of the &`\sm\`& note option (&R; &<<SUBSECTnoteexpr>>&).
.index "optional notes"
This can be useful for indicating optional notes by means of a small notehead
within a chord. This option affects only the notehead; the size of the stem,
the position of any dots, and all other aspects of the note are not changed.

Another way of indicating optional notes is to enclose the notehead in round
brackets (parentheses). This can be requested for individual notes by means of
the &`\)\`& note option (&R; &<<SUBSECTnoteexpr>>&). However, this does not
work for noteheads in a chord that are on the `wrong' side of the stem.



.subsection "Whole bar rests"
.index "rests" "whole bar"
.index "whole bar rests"
There is one other special character that may follow the rest letters R, Q,
S, or T. This is the exclamation mark, and it is used to indicate that the rest
fills an entire bar. Without this, it is not possible to specify a complete
bar's rest as one item in all time signatures. The difference between &`R!`&
and &`Q!`& is that the former outputs a conventional whole bar rest sign,
whereas the latter causes nothing at all to be output in the bar. This is
useful when staves are being overprinted. &`S!`& behaves like &`R!`& except
that the bar in which it appears is never eligible for amalgamation into a
single multiple rest bar with the bars on either side of it. A bar containing
&`S!`& is always shown on its own. &`T!`& is a special notation for the
conventional `repeat last bar' sign (&R; &<<SUBSECTrests>>&.

Whole bar rests specified using an exclamation mark are normally output as
semibreve rests, centred horizontally in the bar. The form of the whole bar
rest sign can be altered for certain time signatures by means of the
&%breverests%& header directive or by using the masquerade facility (&R;
&<<SUBSECTmasquerade>>&).

Rests that happen to fill the bar, but which are not specified with exclamation
marks, are output as rests of the appropriate length. For example, in 3/4 time
the rest &`R.`& is output as a dotted minim rest. If bar lengths are being
checked, such a rest is positioned centred in the bar, but if they are not, it
is put at the left-hand end.

If a bar contains only whole bars rest on some staves and single notes on
others, it sometimes looks better if the notes are also centred in the bar.
This can be done by using the &`\C\`& option for the notes (&R;
&<<SUBSECTnoteexpr>>&).



.subsection "Combining a sequence of rest bars" SUBSECTreprest
.index "rests" "repeated bars"
.index "repeated rest bars"
.index "many bars rest"
.pi sdop "superscript_up=""20"""
When each bar in a sequence of bars contains only a single whole-bar rest
specified using R or Q (but not S or T) they are amalgamated into a single bar.
If the first bar's rest used Q, nothing is output in the bar. Otherwise, a
conventional `long rest' sign is output, with the number of bars above. Of
course, this happens only if all the staves in the system have rest bars,
typically when one or more parts are being extracted from a score. By default,
any number of repeated rest bars are shown in the same way, using the
&+[&{{{zzz&#x0030;}}}&]+& sign, which is the modern convention. Older music
sometimes used special code signs when the number of bars was between two and
eight; see the &%codemultirests%& header directive if you want to use this
style (&R; &<<SUBSECTcodemultirests>>&).
.pi sdop "superscript_up=""33"""

.index "fermata" "with whole bar rest"
A rest bar is considered eligible for amalgamation with its neighbours if it
contains nothing but an unadorned rest item. A rest bar with a fermata on the
rest (for example) is always treated as a separate bar. However, the initial
bar of an amalgamated sequence is permitted to contain items such as key and
time signatures and a beginning repeat mark, and the last bar in a sequence may
end with a terminating repeat sign or a clef. A text item is also permitted in
the first bar of an amalgamated sequence, for example, to specify a tempo. If
you do not want such a bar to be amalgamated, you must specify its rest using S
instead of R.
.code
[10]R! | "G.P." S! | [8]R! |
.endd
If &`R`& is used instead of &`S`& in this example, the last nine bars are
output as a single multi-bar rest when this stave is the only one selected. As
it stands, the G.P. bar is output on its own, followed by an 8-bar multiple
rest.

.index "tacet movements"
.index "repeated rest bars" "width of"
.index "repeated rest bars" "stretching"
When a multi-rest bar is stretched sufficiently, the long rest sign is also
stretched. This provides a way of generating a single multi-rest bar across the
whole page for a &'tacet'& movement in an instrumental part. For example:
.code
[stave 1 treble 1] [space 200][40]R! [endstave]
.endd
If left and right justification is in effect (&R; &<<SUBSECTjustify>>&), all
the &%[space]%& directive has to do is to widen the bar sufficiently for the
justification to kick in. It must be given before the repeat count, to ensure
that the remaining bars contain nothing other than the rest.

If a widened repeated rest is not at the start of a line, and there is
something at the start of the first bar, the situation is a bit more
complicated. Consider:
.code
[stave 1 treble 1] EF | GG | [key E$ space 200][30]R! [endstave]
.endd
Whether the &%[space]%& directive appears before or after the &%[key]%&
directive makes no difference, because what &%[space]%& affects is the position
of the following note or rest. A mid-line key signature is always positioned
relative to the following note/rest position. In this example, the effect of
&%[space]%& is to move both the key signature and long rest sign well to the
right. The (messy) solution is to use &%[move]%& directives to adjust their
positions:
.code
[stave 1 treble 1] EF | GG |
[space 200 move -200 key E$ move -100][30]R!
[endstave]
.endd
Notice that the second &%[move]%& specifies half the distance of the first.
.index "repeated rest bars" "squashing"
The &%[space]%& directive can be used with a small negative argument to make a
repeated rest bar a bit narrower than the default. Reducing it by up to 20
points is usually reasonable.



.subsection "Notes that fill a bar"
.index "notes" "whole bar"
.index "whole bar notes"
Sometimes there is an unorthodox requirement to specify that a note fills a
bar, independent of its conventional length. Here is an example:

.music "music55" 70 4,-16

This effect can be achieved by following a note letter with an exclamation
mark, exactly as for a whole bar rest. The second stave in the example above is
notated like this:
.code
[stave 2 bass 0] G!_ | G! | [endstave]
.endd
By default, a semibreve notehead is output, but this can be changed by using
the masquerade facility (&R; &<<SUBSECTmasquerade>>&).



.subsection "Note expression and options" SUBSECTnoteexpr
.index "notes" "expression"
.index "notes" "options"
.index "notes" "grace"
.index "notes" "accents"
.index "options" "for notes"
The expression/options portion of a note includes all additional marks such as
staccato, emphasis, trills, mordents and fermatas. It can also indicate that
the note is a grace note, force the stem of the note to point up or down,
indicate the lengthening or shortening of the note's stem, change the position
of accents and augmentation dots, and so on. For many notes there are no such
special marks and this part will not be present. When it is present, it
consists of two backslash characters, between which there are one or more
letters or other characters indicating the expression or option required. For
example, a dot and a minus sign signify a staccato dot or a solid line
emphasis, respectively. The possible character sequences that can occur are as
follows:
.index "expression marks"

Here are some examples (there is further discussion below):

.music "music39" 164 4,-8

More than one of these character sequences can be present between the
backslashes, and spaces can be used to separate them, for example:

.itable none 0 0 2  66 left  200 left
.row "&`#g\.-\`&"   "staccato and tenuto"
.row "&`\tr sd\`&"  "trill and stem down"
.endtable

However, staccato and staccatissimo cannot be used together. Notes that are
marked as grace notes can be of any length &-- they do not have to be quavers
or semiquavers. PMW beams grace notes where possible. The stems of grace notes
always point upwards, whatever the pitch, unless an explicit downward stem is
requested by specifying &`\sd\`&.
.index "grace notes, stem direction"
If there is more than one grace note in sequence, specifying a downward
stem for the first one causes all of them to have downward stems.

There are two conventions for notating inverse turns: either a normal turn sign
with a vertical bar through it, or a reversed turn sign. PMW caters for both,
and for completeness also has an reversed turn sign with a bar.

The sequences &`\c\`& and &`\h\`& are used to override the default note placing
when coupled staves are in use (see &%[couple]%&). The single and double colon
options are concerned with the vertical placement of augmentation dots (&R;
&<<SUBSECTdotvert>>&).

When there is a whole bar rest in some staves, and just a single note in the
others, it sometimes looks odd that the rest is centred horizontally in the bar
and the note is not, especially if the note is a semibreve. The option &`\C\`&,
if used on the first note in a bar, causes it to be centred like a whole bar
rest, provided that the note has a length equal to the current bar length. On
any other note or rest &`\C\`& is ignored. In fact, &`\C\`& flips the centring
state of the note or rest, so &`R!\C\`& can be used for a whole bar rest that
is &'not'& centred.

The options that start with the letter &`n`& adjust the notehead setting for an
individual note. The default is set by the &%[noteheads]%& stave directive,
whose description contains the full details (&R; &<<SUBSECTnoteheadstave>>&).
In a chord, these options apply only to the note on which they appear, so it is
possible to have a mixture of noteheads in a chord.


.subsection "General accent notation" SUBSECTgenaccnot
The item &`\a`&<&'n'&>\ is a general notation for specifying accents. The
values that <&'n'&> may take are:

.itable none 0 0 2  12 left  200 left
.row &`1`&    "staccato dot&~ &-[&{>}&]-&"
.row &`2`&    "horizontal bar&~ &-[&{T}&]-&"

.row &`9`&    "`start of bar' accent&~ &{&#156;}&"
.row &`10`&   "staccatissimo mark&~ &{&#194;}&"
.endtable


.subsection "Position of accents and ornaments" SUBSECTposaccorn
By default, accents and the harmonic ring are positioned opposite a note's
stem.
.index "accents" "position of"
That is, they are below the note if the stem is up, and above the note if the
stem is down. (A notional stem direction is computed for breves and
semibreves.) Fermatas, trill signs, and other ornaments are by default placed
above the note, independent of the stem direction.

If an accent or harmonic ring mark is followed by an exclamation mark, PMW
positions it on the same side of the notehead as the stem, which is
occasionally necessary when more than one part is being output on the same
stave. If &`!`& is used with a fermata or trill or other ornament,
.index "fermata" "below note"
.index "trill" "position of"
.index "ornaments" "position of"
.index "bowing marks"
the sign is placed below instead of above the note. String bowing marks are
not affected by the use of the &`!`& option. They are put above the stave
unless the &%[bowing]%& directive has specified otherwise.

.index "accents" "within the stave"
Three accents (staccato, staccatissimo, emphasis bar) and the harmonic circle
are positioned within the stave for notes of an appropriate pitch. Also, they
are placed inside ties and short slurs (&R; &<<SUBSECTshortslur>>&) when they
are both opposite the stem. The other accents and ornaments are always placed
outside the stave and beyond ties and short slurs by default. However, the
position of all accents and ornaments can be adjusted, as described in the next
section.


.subsection "Moving accents and ornaments" SUBSECTmoveaccents
.index "accents" "position of"
.index "accents" "moving"
.index "ornaments" "position of"
.index "ornaments" "moving"
.index "moved accents"
.index "moved ornaments"
It is possible to move all accents and ornaments up and down, or, except for
tremolos, left and right. This is done by placing &`/u`&, &`/d`&, &`/l`&, or
&`/r`&, as appropriate, followed by a number of points, after the accent or
ornament specification.
.code
a\./u4\ g\f/u10\
.endd
This example raises the staccato dot by 4 points and the fermata by 10 points.
For both accents and ornaments, the vertical movement specified is scaled by
the relative size of the stave. Moving an accent does not affect the placement
of anything else. For example, if there is text below a note with an accent
that is also below it, moving the accent does not affect the vertical position
of the text.

There is a possibility of ambiguity if a tremolo and a moved accent or ornament
are specified on the same note, as the tremolo notation is a slash. To avoid
this, the tremolo must be specified before (for example) a fermata: &`g\/f\`&
is correct, but &`g\f/\`& causes an error, because it is taken as a fermata
with an incomplete movement request.

.index "tremolo" "moving"
.index "moved tremolos"
Tremolo markings themselves can be moved up and down, but not left or right.
The notation looks confusing, but is consistent: for example, &`G\//u4\`&
specifies a single tremolo that is moved up by 4 points.


.subsection "Bracketing accents and ornaments"
.index "accents" "bracketing"
.index "ornaments" "bracketing"
.index "bracketing accents"
.index "bracketing ornaments"
Brackets are sometimes used to indicate editorial accents and ornaments. If
there is a sequence of editorially marked notes, the sequence may be
bracketed rather than each individual note. The following may be used after the
specification of any accent or the specification for a fermata, mordant, trill,
or turn, to indicate bracketing:

.itable none 0 0 2  30 left  300 left
.row &`/(`&           "precede with an opening parenthesis"
.row &`/[`&           "precede with an opening square bracket"
.row &`/)`&           "follow with a closing parenthesis"
.row &`/]`&           "follow with a closing square bracket"
.row &`/b`&           "enclose in parentheses"
.row &`/B`&           "enclose in square brackets"
.endtable

Here is a short example:
.code
d'\../b\  e'\../(\  e'\../)\  g\-/B\ |
.endd

.music "music53" 40 4,-14



.subsection "Repeated expression marks" SECTrepexpr
.index "notes" "repeated expression"
.index "repeated expression marks"
If a sequence of notes are all to be marked with the same accent, this can be
specified by giving the expression syntax for one note inside square brackets.
.code
[\.\] a b c d
.endd
This example causes all the notes to be marked staccato. This feature is
limited to accents and a few other expression marks. The only characters that
may appear within backslashes in this context are:

.itable none 0 0 2  60 left  300 left

.row &`///`&         "triple tremolo mark"
.row &`!`&           "put accents on other side of notes"
.endtable

Note that the movement and bracketing options that are available for expression
marks on individual notes cannot be used here. To cancel a setting, two
backslashes with nothing between them should be given between square brackets.
Cancellation can also be carried out for an individual note by means of the
note option letter &`x`&. In the following example, the note D is output
without a staccato dot.
.code
[\.\] a b c d\x\ e f g [\\]
.endd
Expression/option items are processed from left to right. If there are two or
more options being defaulted, &`x`& cancels them all, but any of them can be
put back again afterwards.



.subsection "Stem lengths" SUBSECTstemlengths
.index "length" "of stems"
.index "stems" "length"
The note option consisting of the letters &`sl`& followed by a number is
meaningful for notes shorter than a semibreve. It specifies a lengthening or
shortening of the note's stem. The number specifies the amount by which the
stem is to be changed; positive numbers cause lengthening, negative numbers
cause shortening.
.code
a\sl3.4\  b\sl-1.2\
.endd
This example lengthens the stem of the first note by 3.4 points and shortens
the stem of the second by 1.2 points. PMW maintains a minimum stem length
of 8 points, beyond which shortening is ignored. The &%shortenstems%& header
directive can be used to request PMW automatically to shorten note stems that
point in the `wrong' direction &-- if this is happening, any explicit
adjustment is added to the automatically computed value.

.index "beaming" "stem length"
.index "stems" "length in beam"
The &`sl`& notation for shortening or lengthening the stem of a note works for
beamed as well as unbeamed notes, and is an alternative to the &%[beammove]%&
directive for adjusting the vertical position of beams. (Note that the
&%stemlengths%& setting does not apply to beamed notes.) Lengthening the stem
of any note in a beamed group pushes the beam further away from the noteheads.
However, to move a beam nearer to the noteheads you have to shorten the stems
of all the notes in the beam, which is messier than using &%[beammove]%&.
Consider this example:

.code
[stems up]
g`-c-e-g- |
g`-c-e-\sl5\g- |
g`-\sl-4\c-e-g- |
g`-\sl-4\c-\sl-4\e-\sl-4\g-\sl-4\ |
[beammove -4] g`-c-e-g- |
.endd

.music "music58" 40 10,-16

In the first bar there are no stem length adjustments. In the second bar, the
third note has its stem lengthened by 5 points, causing the other notes' stems
also to be lengthened to make them join the beam. In the third bar, one note's
stem is shortened, but this has no effect because the other notes still have
full-length stems. In the fourth bar, all the notes' stems are shortened. In
the fifth bar, the same effect is achieved using &%[beammove]%&.



.subsection "Masquerading notes and rests" SUBSECTmasquerade
.index "masquerading notes"
.index "notes" "masquerading"
.index "rests" "masquerading"
For special effects (for example, tremolos between notes &-- see &%[tremolo]%&)
it is sometimes desirable to use a note or rest of one kind in place of
another, for example a crotchet instead of a quaver, or a breve instead of a
semibreve. This kind of &'masquerading'& is requested by the letter &`m`& in
the options part of the note, and the type of note required is indicated by the
form of the &`m`& in the same way as for normal notes. For a chord, the
masquerade indication must appear on the first note.

The only effect of masquerading is to substitute a different note for display;
the position of the note is not affected. Masquerading does not disable
beaming. When a masquerade is requested, an augmentation dot can be requested
with it, and if it is not, no dot is output, even if the original note is
augmented.
.index "dotted notes" "dot before bar line"
The ability to add augmentation dots makes it easier to set renaissance music
in the style with a dot before a bar line instead of a tie to a quaver in the
next bar.

.itable none 0 0 2  60 left  300 left
.row &`G+\M++\`&    "outputs a breve instead of a semibreve"
.row &`g-\m\`&      "outputs a crotchet instead of a quaver"
.row &`g.\M\`&      "outputs an undotted minim instead of a dotted crotchet"
.row &`g\m.\`&      "adds a dot to a crotchet without lengthening it"
.endtable

If the note is beamed, this option is restricted in its use: the only available
facility is to print a minim notehead instead of a crotchet notehead.
.code
g-\M\ b- d'-
.endd
.index "beaming" "across rests"
In this example, the first notehead is shown as a minim. Masquerade requests
for noteheads other than minims are ignored within beams. However, masqueraded
&'rests'& are not restricted within beamed groups. This makes it possible to
print (unconventionally) a crotchet rest under a beam, by using a construction
such as &`r-\m\q-`& within a beamed group. Note the use of an invisible quaver
rest to make the item's length up to a crotchet.



.subsection "Expression items on rests"
.index "rests" "expression items"
.index "expression items and rests"
Accent marks are not supported on rests, but pause marks (fermatas) are
permitted. Other ornaments such as turns are allowed on invisible rests only.
This gives a way of outputting these marks on their own at positions in a bar
that are not associated with visible notes.





.subsection "Changing rest levels" SUBSECTchrele
.index "rests" "level"
.index "height of rests"
A note option consisting of the letter &`l`& followed by a number is permitted
for rests only. A negative number may be specified. This has the effect of
moving the rest vertically up (for positive numbers) or down (for negative
numbers) by the given number of points.
.code
R\l4\
.endd
This example outputs a minim rest on the fourth instead of the third line. If
rests are generally to be appear at a non-standard level, the &%[rlevel]%&
directive can be used to avoid having to give this option on every rest. If
this option is used in conjunction with &%[rlevel]%& or &%[move]%&, the effect
is cumulative.



.subsection "Ties and short slurs" SUBSECTshortslur
.index "ties" "specifying"
.index "slurs" "over two notes, specifying"
.index "short slurs (over two notes)"
Two adjacent notes may be tied, or a slur generated between them, by ending the
first note with an underline character. PMW does not distinguish between a tie
and a slur between two adjacent single notes, except that when the underline
represents a tie (the two notes have the same pitch), the stem direction of the
second note defaults to being the same as that of the first note, and if a MIDI
file is being generated, the tie is honoured. The stem direction defaulting
does not happen in the case of a short slur, when the two notes have different
pitches. In both cases, explicit stem directions can be specified if the
defaults are not what you want.

.index "chords" "tied"
In contrast to single notes, when an underscore follows a chord it causes tie
lines to be drawn only between notes of the same pitch in the chord and the
following chord. Thus an underscore always represents one or more ties when it
follows a chord. The &%[slur]%& directive must be used when slurs are required
between adjacent chords (and when slurs cover more than two single notes). If
two notes (or chords) that form part of a beam are tied, it does not cause the
beam to be broken. An explicit beam break must be specified if required.

.index "ties" "direction"
Ties are normally put on the opposite side of the noteheads to the stems. A
tie on a single note can be forced to be above or below the notehead by adding
the qualifier &`/a`& or &`/b`& after the underline character.
.code
a_/a | a e'_/b | e'
.endd
In this example, the tie between the A notes is forced above, and the tie
between the E notes is forced below. Such an indication takes precedence over
the &%[ties]%& stave directive, which sets a default position for all
subsequent ties. The same qualifiers are also available for chords, where they
force &'all'& the tie marks to be drawn in the specified direction. It is also
possible, for a chord, to specify that only some of the tie marks are to be
drawn above or below the noteheads, the remainder appearing on the opposite
side. This is done by inserting a digit between the &`/`& character and the
letter that follows.
.code
(ace)_/1a (ace)   (dfa)_/2b (dfa)
.endd
These examples show two different ways of specifying that one of the three tie
marks is to be drawn above the noteheads, with the other two below.



.subsection "Editorial and intermittent ties"
.index "editorial ties"
.index "ties" "editorial"
.index "dashed ties"
.index "ties" "dashed"
.index "dotted ties"
.index "ties" "dotted"
Ties can be marked editorial, or drawn dashed or dotted, by means of
the following qualifiers, which are the same options as for slurs:

.itable none 0 0 2  30 left  300 left
.row &`/e`&     "editorial &-- a short line is drawn through the tie"
.row &`/i`&     "intermittent &-- that is, dashed"
.row &`/ip`&    "intermittent periods, that is, dotted"
.endtable


.subsection "Hanging ties" SUBSECThangingties
.index "hanging ties"
.index "ties" "hanging"
.index "invisible items" "notes"
.index "notes" "invisible"
Occasionally there is a requirement to print tie marks that do not end on
another note or chord, but simply extend some distance to the right to indicate
that the note or chord should be held on for some time. These can be notated by
making the second note or chord invisible using the stave directive &%[notes
off]%&. In the case of a chord, the ends of all the tie marks are vertically
aligned when this is done. To help with the positioning of the ends of this
kind of tie, tie marks are allowed to continue over rests (usually invisible
ones).
.code
(cde)_ | qq [notes off] (cde) [notes on] |
.endd
This example extends the ties to the position of the third crotchet in an
otherwise empty bar.



.subsection "Glissando marks"
.index "glissandos"
Glissando marks are available for single notes but not for chords. The
glissando notation is an extension of the short slur notation. If a short slur
mark (underscore) is followed by &`/g`&, a glissando line is drawn between the
relevant notes. If both a slur and a glissando mark are required, &`/s`& must
be added. If the slur is being forced above or below with &`/a`& or &`/b`&, it
is not necessary to use &`/s`&.

.itable none 0 0 2  90 left  200 left
.row &`f_`&        "slur only"
.row &`f_/g`&      "glissando only"
.row &`f_/s/g`&    "glissando and slur"
.row &`f_/g/a`&    "glissando and slur, slur above"
.endtable

It may occasionally be necessary to insert extra space between notes that are
joined by glissando marks. There are examples of the use of glissandos in
sections &<<SECTtiesslurs>>& and &<<SUBSECTrottext>>&.



.subsection "Triplets and other irregular note groups" SUBSECTtupletintro
.index "irregular note groups"
In his book &'Music Notation'&, Gardner Read writes: &'Notating unequal groups
&-- triplets against duplets or quadruplets, quintuplets against triplets, and
so on &-- is one of the musician's most perplexing problems.'& PMW handles
simple cases straightforwardly, but also has facilities for dealing with more
general groups. One complication is in the choice of note-value to use for the
irregular group. Gardner Read says: &'The note-values of the extraordinary
group are always determined by the note-values of the ordinary group against
which they are set.'& [&mldr;] &'When, however, the number of notes in the
irregular group exceeds twice the number of note-values in the regular group,
the uncommon group must employ the next smaller note-value'&.

This is not as simple as it sounds. Consider the case of five equal notes in a
bar in 3/4 time. If the regular group is three crotchets, the irregular group
should use crotchets because five is less than twice three; however, if the
regular group is six quavers, the irregular group must use quavers, because an
irregular group never uses longer notes than the regular group.

.music "music49" 72 4,-14

In PMW input, brace characters (curly brackets) are used to enclose a group of
notes that is not a standard division of a longer note or group. In simple
cases, the opening brace is followed by a single number to indicate the number
of notes in the irregular group. If this number is omitted, the group is
assumed to be a triplet.
.itable none 0 0 2  120 left  200 left

.row "&`{a b c}`&"         "three crotchets in the time of two"
.row "&`{2 g-a-}`&"        "two quavers in the time of three"
.row "&`{5 c-d-e-f-g-}`&"  "five quavers in the time of four"
.endtable

By default, PMW makes assumptions about the size of the regular group that is
being subdivided, based on the number of subdivisions. However, in order to
cope with more complicated cases, another parameter may also be set. The
general form of an irregular note group is:
.display
&`{`&&'s'&&`/`&&'n'&&` `&<&'notes...'&>&`}`&
.endd
The number of notes in the irregular group is &'n'&, and &'s'& controls the
size of the group that is being divided. If &'s'& (and its slash) are
omitted, as in the simple examples above, a default value is chosen that works
well in most common cases:

.ilist
If &'n'& is a power of two (2, 4, 8, 16), &'s'& defaults to three. Thus,
the example &`{2`& &` g-a-}`& above is equivalent to &`{3/2`& &`g-a-}`&.
.next
Otherwise, the default is two, so the example &`{5`& &`c-d-e-f-g-}`& above is
equivalent to &`{2/5`& &`c-d-e-f-g-}`&.
.endlist

A note in an irregular group can be longer or shorter than a normal note of the
same type. For example, in a duplet, notes are longer, whereas in a triplet
they are shorter. PMW modifies the lengths of irregular notes as follows:

.olist
When &'n'& is less than 2*&'s'&, the lengths of the notes in the irregular
group are multiplied by &'s'&&`/`&&'n'&. In a triplet such as &`{g-g-g-}`&,
where &'s'& and &'n'& have their default values of two and three, respectively,
each quaver is shortened to 2/3 of its normal length, so three of them take up
the time of two normal quavers.
.next
When &'n'& is 2*&'s'& or more, but less than 4*&'s'&, the lengths of the notes
in the irregular group are multiplied by (2*&'s'&)/&'n'&. Thus every
note in the group &`{2/5`& &`c-d-e-f-g-}`& is multiplied by 4/5, giving a total
of four regular quavers, that is, two crotchets.
.next
When &'n'& is 4*&'s'& or more, the lengths of the notes in the irregular group
are multiplied by (4*&'s'&)/&'n'&.
.endlist

These rules are sufficient to handle most cases. For example, the group &`{7`&
&`f-g-a-b-f-a-g-}`& is a division of two crotchets into seven quavers.
However, a division of three crotchets into seven quavers is notated on the
music stave in exactly the same manner &-- music notation is ambiguous in this
respect. It is not possible to determine what a group of quavers with a `7'
above it actually means, without looking at the time signature or the rest of
the bar, and PMW is not capable of analysing bars in this detail. This is an
example of a case where it is necessary to specify &'s'& explicitly; the code
for dividing three crotchets into seven quavers is &`{3/7`&
&`f-g-a-b-f-a-g-}`&. Because of rule (2) above, this means that each note's
length is multipled by 6/7 instead of 4/7.

Published music is not always consistent in how some larger groups are notated.
PMW can handle some of the alternative requirements. A division of three
crotchets into 11 should use quavers, because 11 is less than 12, the number of
semiquavers in three crotchets. The normal coding would be:
.code
{3/11 g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-}
.endd
However, if you want to notate three crotchets divided into eleven, but using
semiquavers instead of quavers, you can use this:
.code
{12/11 g=g=g=g=g=g=g=g=g=g=g=}
.endd
The length of each semiquaver is multiplied by 12/11, so the length of the
group is 12 semiquavers, that is, three crotchets. The illustration below shows
some of the examples discussed in this section, with regular groups on a
second stave to show how the irregular groups are interpreted.

.music "music48" 132 4,-20



.subsection "Nested irregular note groups"
.index "nested irregular note groups"
.index "irregular note groups" "nested"
From release 5.33, PMW supports the nesting of irregular note groups, for
example:
.code
g b {/a e'c' {c'-c'-c'-} }
.endd

.music "music72" 50 4,-6



.subsection "Options for irregular note groups"
By default, PMW puts the number of an irregular note group (for example,
the `3' for a triplet) on the same side of the noteheads as the stems. The
&%tupletfont%& directive is used to specify the size and type of font used. If
the notes are beamed, just the number is output; if not, a horizontal
`bracket' is drawn as well.
.index "irregular note groups" "suppressing the number"
.index "irregular note groups" "moving the number"
The whole mark can be moved, forced to be above or below the stave, and the
horizontal bracket can be omitted. The mark may also be totally suppressed.
The &%[tuplets]%& directive can be used to set defaults for some of these
options. For individual groups, the following qualifiers may appear after the
opening curly bracket, following any numbers that may be present:

.itable none 0 0 2  60 left  200 left
.row &`/a`&          "put mark above"
.row &`/a`&<&'n'&>   "put mark <&'n'&> points above"
.row &`/b`&          "put mark below"
.row &`/b`&<&'n'&>   "put mark <&'n'&> points below"
.row &`/n`&          "omit bracket"
.row &`/x`&          "suppress/unsuppress mark"
.row " "
.row &`/lx`&         "invert left-hand jog"
.row &`/rx`&         "invert right-hand jog"
.row " "
.row &`/d`&<&'n'&>   "move mark down <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/l`&<&'n'&>   "move mark left <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/r`&<&'n'&>   "move mark right <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/u`&<&'n'&>   "move mark up <&'n'&> points"
.row " "
.row &`/ld`&<&'n'&>  "move left end of bracket down <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/lu`&<&'n'&>  "move left end of bracket up <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/rd`&<&'n'&>  "move right end of bracket down <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/ru`&<&'n'&>  "move right end of bracket up <&'n'&> points"
.endtable

The &`/x`& option suppresses the mark unless &%[tuplets]%& has been used to
suppress all irregular note group marks, in which case &`/x`& causes the mark
to appear. When a dimension is given after &`/a`& or &`/b`&, the value given is
the position above or below the stave of the baseline of the numerical text for
a horizontal bracket. Subsequent adjustment of either end of the bracket is
then possible, as described above. If no dimension is given after &`/a`& or
&`/b`&, the vertical position is computed from the positions of the notes that
form the group. The left and right movements are available only if no
horizontal bracket is being output; they are ignored otherwise. Here are some
examples of the use of these options:
.code
{3/5/d1 a-a-a-b-b-}  {/b a-b-c-}  {/a/u3 dfg}  {2/d2/n a-a-}
.endd
If either of the &`/a`& or &`/b`& options is specified, it is assumed that the
mark is being moved to the other side of the noteheads, and therefore the
bracket is automatically added. The &`/n`& qualifier must be used if a bracket
is not required in this circumstance.

By default, PMW draws the brackets for irregular note groups horizontal.
Occasionally a sloping bracket is required; these can be obtained by means of
the &`/lu`&, &`/ld`&, &`/ru`&, and &`/rd`& options on the opening curly
bracket. They have the effect of moving the left or right hand ends of the
bracket up or down, respectively, by an amount specified after the option.
.code
{/ld10 dfa}
.endd
This example moves the left hand end down by 10 points. Very occasionally, when
using coupled staves, it is useful to be able to alter the direction of the
`jog' at one end of a tuplet bracket so that it points in the opposite
direction to the jog at the other end. The qualifiers &`/lx`& and &`/rx`&
request this, for the left-hand and right-hand jogs, respectively.



.subsection "Beam breaking in irregular note groups"
.index "irregular note groups" "beaming"
.index "beaming" "irregular note groups"
The appearance of an irregular note group does not of itself cause a break in
the beaming, and an explicit beam break must be specified if required.
Strictly, tie and beam breaking indicators are supposed to come immediately
after the final note, before the terminating } character, but in fact PMW
allows the } character to precede or follow the tie and beam indicators. Thus
the following are all permitted:
.code
{g=g=g=,}g=  {g=g=g=},g=  {g=g=g=_}g
{g=g=g=}_g   {g=g=g=}_,g= {g=g=g=_;}g=
.endd
The only restriction is that (as elsewhere) a tie indicator must precede a beam
break.



.subsection "Treating certain regular groups as triplets" SUBSECTtripletize
.index "triplets" "assumed for alignment and MIDI"
.index "&%[tripletize]%&"
In some music, note pairs consisting of a dotted quaver followed by a
semiquaver are intended to be performed as triplets, that is, with the
semiquaver taken as a third of a crotchet, instead of a quarter. This notation
can be seen in some Telemann manuscripts, for example. In light popular music,
such groups may also be `swung' into triplets. This performance convention does
not cause any problems when considering a single part, but for a score that has
actual triplets in another part, semiquavers after dotted quavers are not by
default vertically aligned with the final triplet notes in other parts. PMW has
a facility for adjusting the output so that the noteheads do line up. In the
following example, the first bar shows what happens by default; in the second
bar the bass part has been `tripletized'.

.music "music56" 80 4,-21

The form of the notes remains the same, but their performance length has been
adjusted, which affects the horizontal position of the semiquavers. The
adjusted note lengths are also used when MIDI output is generated.

The &%[tripletize]%& directive controls this behaviour. It can be followed by
one of the words `on' or `off'. If neither is present, `on' is assumed. At the
start of a stave, tripletizing is turned off. When turned on, in addition to
dotted quaver pairs, groups consisting of a dotted crotchet followed by a
quaver or two semiquavers (notes or rests) are also adjusted. For such groups,
a quaver is treated as having the length of two thirds of a crotchet, or the
semiquavers are each treated as having the length of one third of a crotchet,
and the dotted crotchet's length is appropriately shortened.






.subsection "Short cuts for inputting notes" SUBSECTshortcuts
.index "input short cuts"
.index "repeated notes"
.index "repetition" "notes"
.index "notes" "repeated"
.index "notes" "short cut entry"
.index "short cut note entry"
Some short cuts are available to reduce the amount of typing needed when
inputting notes. They do not affect the appearance of the output in any way.
.ilist
The previous note or chord can be repeated exactly, including its expression
marks or ornaments, by using the letter &`x`& instead of a note letter. An
optional number may follow &`x`& to indicate the number of repetitions. A beam
break (&R; &<<SECTbeaming>>&) or a tie may follow, and a subsequent &`x`& can
be used for further repetitions. For example, a bar of eight identical quaver
chords, broken in the middle, can be notated like this:
.code
(e-gb) x3; x4 |
.endd
A rest may intervene between the original note and its copy, but there must be
no clef, octave, or transposition change between them.

.next
The previous note or chord's pitches can be copied, with a different note
length and with its own options, by using the letter &`p`& instead of a note
letter. The length of the note is determined by the case of the letter &`p`&
and any hyphens, equals, or plus signs that follow, and normal note options
such as staccato, etc., may follow as well. As in the case of &`x`&, there must
be no clef, octave, or transposition change between the original and the copy.
For example, a dotted crotchet chord followed by a quaver chord of the same
pitches can be notated like this:
.code
(d.fa) p-
.endd
.endlist
A note defined with the letter &`p`& can be followed by another &`p`&, possibly
with a different note length, and &`x`& may follow &`p`& and &'vice versa'&.
For both &`x`& and &`p`&, accidentals are not repeated within a bar, though
they affect the pitch if a MIDI file is being generated. However, when &`x`& or
&`p`& is used at the start of a bar, and the note or chord is not tied to the
previous one (in the previous bar), the accidentals are repeated. If such a
note or chord is tied to the previous one, no accidentals are shown, but if
&`p`& or &`x`& follows, the accidentals &'are'& repeated, according to the
usual notation convention.
.code
a b #c_ | P p x
.endd
In this example, the minim at the start of the second bar does not have an
accidental, but there is one before the following crotchet.


.section "Note beaming" SECTbeaming
.index "notes" "beaming"
.index "beaming" "breaking a beam"
.index "breaking a beam"
PMW makes no beaming breaking decisions based on position in the bar or any
other criteria, but leaves it entirely up to the creator of the input file to
specify what is required. The &%beamthickness%& header directive can be used
to set the thickness of line used for drawing beams.


.subsection "Beam breaking"
.index "semicolon" "beam breaking"
.index "; (semicolon)" "beam breaking"
.index "comma" "beam breaking"
.index ", (comma)" "beam breaking"
Notes and chords shorter than a crotchet are automatically beamed together
unless they are separated in the input by one of the following beam breaking
characters:
.display
&`;`&    break all beams (semicolon)
&`,`&    break secondary beams only (comma)
.endd
These characters are ignored if they follow longer notes.
.index "beaming" "across rests"
.index "rests" "beaming across"
PMW automatically beams across rests that are shorter than a crotchet, unless a
break in the beam is specified. A beam breaking character must appear after the
end of a note or after the closing parenthesis of a chord, though if the note
or chord is tied (with an underscore character), the beam break must follow the
underscore. If any other character follows a note or chord, no breaking
happens. If the note or chord is the last of an irregular group (for example,
triplets), the beam break may optionally appear after the closing curly
bracket. Three pairs of beamed quavers could be notated like this:
.code
g-e-; f-a-; b-a-
.endd
A single digit may follow a comma to specify how many beams &'not'& to break
&-- no digit is equivalent to 1.
.code
g=-a=-b=-,2 c'=-d'=-e'=-
.endd
This example results in two solid beams, with a third that is broken in the
middle. A value that is too large causes no beams to be broken.
.index "beaming" "aligning adjacent beams"
A value of zero causes all beams to be broken; this is different to the normal
semicolon beam break, because it causes the beams on either side of the break
to align with each other. After a secondary beam break, a small amount of extra
horizontal space (1.3 points) is inserted. Without this, the gap that has only
a primary beam appears to be too narrow.


.subsection "Beaming over bar lines" SUBSECTbeamoverbar
.index "beaming" "over bar lines"
.index "bar lines" "beaming over"
Consistent syncopation employing beamed notes is more logical and more graphic
when the beaming is carried across the bar lines. This effect can be achieved
in PMW by following the bar character by the &`=`& character.
.code
r- g g- |= g-; g g- |= g-; g r- |
.endd

.music "music59" 24 0,-22

This notation causes a beamed group to extend into the subsequent bar; in the
example above, two pairs of beamed quavers each straddle a bar line. Without
the &`=`& characters after the bar characters, each quaver would be separate. A
single beam can be carried over one bar line only; it cannot be continued over
a second bar line. However, as the example shows, a bar may have carried-over
beams at both ends.

When such a beamed group occurs at the end of a system, the beam is drawn to
the final bar line, and, on the next system, an `incoming' beam is drawn to
indicate the continuation. By default, this has the same slope as the first
part of the beam. This can, however, be altered by means of the &%[beamslope]%&
directive, placed at the start of the second bar. A &%[beammove]%& directive
can also be used in this position, where it will affect only the continued
portion of the beam.

&*Warning:*& Because PMW normally works on only one bar at a time, continued
beams are not handled in quite the same way as other beams. In particular, the
computation of stem directions for the notes takes place independently in each
bar, taking into account only the notes in that bar. This means that in some
cases the notes in the second bar will by default have their stems in the
opposite direction to the rest of the beam. This is not usually what is wanted,
and it can give rise to errors when PMW cannot fit the notes on both sides of
the beam. In these cases, it is necessary to specify an explicit stem direction
for the first note of the second bar.



.subsection "Beaming across rests at beam ends" SECTbeamendrests
.index "beaming" "across rests at beam ends"
.index "rests" "beaming across"
A recent innovation in notation is the continuation of beams over rests when
they are at the start or end of the beam. This is thought to be helpful in
indicating rhythmic groupings.
.index "&%beamendrests%&"
.index "&%nobeamendrests%&"
PMW handles rests in the middle of beams automatically, but does not by default
draw beams over rests at the ends of beams. If you want this to happen, you can
request it by specifying &%beamendrests%& in the header. There is also
&%nobeamendrests%&, which can be used to cancel this effect in a subsequent
movement. Explicit beam breaks can be used to prevent an individual beam from
covering a rest.
Vertical movement of the rests is taken into account when computing the
position of the beam. As in all beams, this can be adjusted by means of the
.index "&%[beammove]%&"
&%[beammove]%& directive.
Beams covering rests at the end may be continued over bar lines, as described
in the previous section, but only if there is at least one non-rest in the
first bar.



.subsection "Accelerando and ritardando beams" SUBSECTaccritbeams
.index "beaming" "accel. and rit. "
.index "accelerando beams"
.index "ritardando beams"
.index "&%[beamacc]%&"
.index "&%[beamrit]%&"
In modern music, accelerandos and ritardandos are sometimes notated by beams
that fan out or in. PMW has some simple support. The stave directives
&%[beamacc]%& and &%[beamrit]%& specify that the next beamed group in the bar
is of the appropriate type. The notes of the group should normally be input as
quavers. In most cases they are an irregular group and need to be enclosed in
curly brackets, with an appropriate number. It is not usual to print the
number, so this is normally turned off by means of the &`/x`& option on the
irregular note group.

PMW outputs accelerando and ritardando groups by drawing the primary beam as
normal, then drawing one or two more inside beams, with one end fixed and the
other getting nearer to the noteheads. By default, three beams in total are
drawn, but this number can be changed in the &%[beamacc]%& or &%[beamrit]%&
directive by following it with the number 2, in which case only two beams are
drawn. This setting lasts until the end of the stave, or until a subsequent
&%[beamacc]%& or &%[beamrit]%& directive containing the number 3 is
encountered.

The slope of the primary beam is the same as it would be for a conventional
beamed group. If this is horizontal, a `fanned' beam does not always look
right, and it is necessary to use the &%[beamslope]%& directive to change it.
.code
[beamslope 0.1]  [beamacc]   {5/x g-g-g-g-g-} |
[beamslope -0.1] [beamrit]   {5/x g-g-g-g-g-} |
[beamslope 0.1]  [beamacc 2] {5/x g-g-g-g-g-} |
[beamslope -0.1] [beamrit]   {5/x g-g-g-g-g-} |
.endd

.music "music38" 32 4,-20

In some cases it is also necessary to move the beams away from the noteheads
using the &%[beammove]%& directive.


.subsection "Beams with notes on both sides" SUBSECTbeamsides
.index "beaming" "notes on both sides"
.index "notes" "on both sides of beam"
The stem direction that is determined for a beamed group by the rules
described in section &<<SECTstemdir>>& is the default, that is, it is the
direction used for those notes in the group whose direction is not otherwise
specified. It is possible to have notes on the non-default side of the beam by
requesting an explicit stem direction for them. This facility is of most use in
two-stave keyboard parts when the staves are `coupled' (see the &%[couple]%&
directive). If there is a run of notes on one side of the beam followed by a
run of notes on the other side, the note option &`\sw\`& can be used to swap
the default stem direction for the note on which it appears and for all
subsequent notes in the beam, but only if the first note of the beam has its
direction explicitly specified.
.code
[stave 1 treble 1 couple down]
g`-f`-a-\sd\ | e`-\su\f`-g`-g-\sw\a-b- |
[endstave]
[stave 2 bass 0]
q-q-q- | Q! |
[endstave]
.endd

.music "music40" 64 8,-20

In this example, the default stem direction for the first beam is upwards
because of the two low notes, but the third note has its stem forced downwards,
so is put on the other side of the beam. The &`\su\`& option in the second
beam causes the first three notes to have their stems up, and the &`\sw\`&
option forces the last three to have their stems down. This option can be used
as many times as necessary in a beam. If &`\su\`& were not present on the first
note, &`\sw\`& could not be used on the fourth, because the default direction
is not known at the time &`\sw\`& it is processed (it depends on the pitches of
all the notes in the beam).

The arrangement of beams and beamlets for beams with notes on both sides
follows the general principle of attempting to avoid `beam corners' wherever
possible. Some variation in this arrangement can be obtained by making use of
secondary beam breaks. The &%[beamslope]%& and &%[beammove]%& directives, which
adjust the slope and vertical position of a beam, can be used as for any other
beam. When there are only two notes in a beam, it is almost always possible to
arrange them with their stems going in opposite directions, even though
sometimes this leads to extremely slanted beams. When there are more than two
notes, however, it is sometimes not possible to find a way of positioning the
beam if the notes are too close together in pitch. When this happens, PMW
outputs an error message.



.section "Stem directions" SECTstemdir
.index "stems" "direction"
.index "direction of stems"
.index "notes" "stem direction"
This section documents the default rules for choosing a stem direction for
a note or a chord. Some variation in the rules can be made by means of the
&%stemswap%& header directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTstemswap>>&). The `stem swap
level' is normally the middle line of the stave, but can be changed by the
&%stemswaplevel%& directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTstemswaplevel>>&).

.subsection "Preliminary"
1. The `pitch' of a chord, for stem-decision purposes, is the average pitch of
its highest and lowest notes.

2. The `pitch' of a beamed group, for stem-decision purposes, is the pitch of
the note that is furthest away from the stem swap level.

3. Stem directions are computed for all notes, even breves and semibreves. In
the case of these long notes the notional stem direction can affect the stems
of subsequent or previous notes, and also the layout of chords containing
adjacent notes.


.subsection "Rules for non-beamed notes and chords"
These rules are given in order of priority. `The previous note' includes the
last note of a previous beamed group, if relevant. What happens to notes at the
stemswap level (rules N5 and N6) can be changed by use of the &%stemswap%&
directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTstemswap>>&).

N1. If an explicit stem direction is specified on a note, it is used.

N2. If a default is set by the stave directive &%[stems up]%& or &%[stems
down]%&, it is used.

N3. If the note is tied to the previous note, that is, the previous note is
followed by an underscore and has the same pitch, the same direction as
the previous note is used, even if this note is the first in a bar, provided
the previous note's direction does not depend on this note's.

N4. If the note is above or below the stem swap level, its stem goes down or
up, respectively.

N5. The note is at the stem swap level. If it is the first in the bar, or if
all preceding notes in the bar have used this rule, its stem goes the same way
as the next note in the bar that does not use this rule. If there are no more
such notes in the bar, its stem goes the same way as the last note of the
previous bar. If this is the first bar of the piece, the stem goes up.

N6. The stem goes the same way as the previous note.


.subsection "Rules for beamed groups"
.index "beaming" "default stem direction"
.index "stems" "direction in beamed groups"
B1. If the stem direction of the first note in the group is forced by N1, N2,
or N3 above, that direction is used as the default for the group.

B2. If the `pitch' of the beamed group is above or below the stem swap level,
the stems go down or up, respectively, by default.

B3. The default stem direction is taken from the previous note. If there is no
previous note, the stems go upwards.

Normally, all the notes in a beam are on the same side of the beam, with their
stems in the default direction for the beam, but it is possible to specify that
some are on the other side of the beam (&R; &<<SUBSECTbeamsides>>&).


.section "Text strings in stave data" SECTtextitems
.index "text" "on staves"
.index "underlay"
.index "overlay"
.index "figured bass" "specifying"
Section &<<SECTunderlay>>& gives details of the special facilities that are
applicable only to underlay or overlay text, that is, the sung words (lyrics)
in a voice part. This section applies to text in general, with some particular
features that are relevant only for non-underlay/overlay text. By default, text
strings are output below the stave in an italic font, and positioned according
to the following note. The &%[textfont]%& directive can be used to specify a
default font for ordinary (that is, not underlay, overlay, or figured bass)
text. Rehearsal marks are a special form of text and are specified in a
slightly different manner (&R; &<<SECTrehearse>>&).

The &%[text]%& directive provides a way of changing the default position of the
text to be above the stave, rather than below; it can specify a fixed position
(above or below the stave) or allow the position to be determined by PMW.
Alternatively, &%[text]%& can specify that unqualified strings are underlay,
overlay, or figured bass text. Any individual string can always be explicitly
qualified to indicate its type. Underlay, overlay, and figured bass text is by
default output in the roman typeface. The directives &%[underlayfont]%&,
&%[overlayfont]%&, and &%[fbfont]%& can be used to change the default font for
these kinds of text on individual staves.

Text strings, enclosed in double quote characters, are coded in among the notes
of a stave.
.index "strings" "limit on number of"
There may be no more than 100 text strings before any one note; this large limit
is intended to cover all possible applications. The escape character
conventions using the backslash character that apply to all PMW strings are
relevant (&R; &<<SECTtextstrings>>&). In particular, within any text string,
the font can be changed by the use of the appropriate escape sequences. The
closing double-quote of the string may be followed by one or more qualifiers,
separated from the quote and from each other by slash characters. The following
are available:
.index "text" "qualifiers"

If any of the movement options are repeated on a string, their effect is
cumulative. This feature is useful when a repeated string with a movement
option is defined as a macro, but in some instances needs further adjustment.
These two examples have exactly the same effect:
.code
"allargando"/u6/d2
"allargando"/u4
.endd
If more than one of &`/a`&, &`/ao`&, &`/b`&, &`/bu`&, &`/m`&, &`/ul`&, &`/ol`&,
&`/fb`&, or &`/fbu`& is present, the last one takes precedence. If none of them
are present, the string type is taken from the last &%[text]%& directive. If
&%[text]%& has not been used on the current stave, &`/b`& is assumed. There is
an important difference between &`/bu`& and &`/ul`&, and similarly between
&`/ao`& and &`/ol`&. When &`/bu`& is specified, the text is treated as
non-underlay text, but its default vertical position is the underlay level.
This contrasts with &`/ul`&, which indicates that the text &'is'& underlay, and
subject to special processing described in section &<<SECTunderlay>>&.

The &`/m`& option is like &`/b`&, except that the default vertical position of
the text is in the middle of the space between the current stave and the one
below it, provided this is lower than the normal &`/b`& position would be. This
is useful for dynamic marks in keyboard parts. If two overprinting staves are
being used for a keyboard part, text with the &`/m`& option may appear with
either of them, because if the space after the current stave is set to zero,
the space for the next stave is used when positioning such text.

.index "text" "vertical position"
The default vertical position of text is adjusted to take account of the next
note, unless the string is forced to the overlay or underlay level by &`/ol`&,
&`/ul`&, or &`/fbu`&, or to an absolute position by &`/a<&'n'&>`& or
&`/b<&'n'&>`&.
.code
"at underlay level"/ul
"six points above the stave"/a6
"twenty points below the stave"/b20
.endd
By default, if two or more strings precede the same note or the end of a bar,
the default vertical position for the second and subsequent strings is an
appropriate distance above (for text above the stave) or below (for text below
the stave) the previous string. There is, however, a facility for horizontal
concatenation (&R; &<<SUBSECTfollowon>>&). The level of any string can always
be adjusted by the use of &`/u`& or &`/d`&.


.subsection "Horizontal alignment" SECThorizalign
.index "text" "horizontal alignmnent"
.index "text" "end alignment"
The horizontal alignment of underlay and overlay strings is described in
section &<<SECTunderlay>>&. Except for follow-on strings (&R;
&<<SUBSECTfollowon>>&), unqualified strings are positioned by default with
their first character aligned with the left-hand edge of the next note or rest,
or with the bar line if there are no following notes or rests in the bar.

If the &`/e`& qualifier is present on the text string, it is the end of the
string that is aligned with the alignment point. The &`/ne`& option can be used
on text strings to cancel the effect of a previous &`/e`&. This can be useful
for overriding options on strings defined as macros.

.index "text" "centred"
.index "text" "centred in bar"
If the &`/c`& qualifier is present, the text is centred at the alignment point.
If this is used on text immediately before a whole bar rest that is centred in
the bar, the text is centred in the bar. This applies to both visible and
invisible whole bar rests. The &`/nc`& option can be used on text strings to
cancel the effect of a previous &`/c`&. This can be useful for overriding
options on strings defined as macros.

.index "text" "centre in bar"
If the &`/cb`& qualifier is present, the text is centred in the bar. Such a
string may appear anywhere in a bar. This qualifier unsets any previous
horizontal positioning, but relative movement left or right is honoured.

The &`/l`& and &`/r`& qualifiers move a string left or right with respect to
the default position, and there are several qualifiers that can be used to vary
the position of the alignment point itself. If more than one of these is
present, the earliest described here takes precedence (for example, &`/bar`&
overrides &`/ts`& and &`/h`& overrides &`/rc`&).

If &`/bar`& is present, the alignment point is the previous bar line, or the
start of the system for the first bar in a system. If the &`/ts`& option is
present, the alignment point is the time signature at the start of the bar. If
there isn't one, the alignment point is the first note in the bar. For both
&`/bar`& and &`/ts`& the vertical position of the string still depends on the
note that follows it.

The &`/h`& option causes the alignment point to be halfway between the next
note or rest and the note or rest that follows, or the end of the bar if there
is only one note or rest following in the bar. The &`/e`& and &`/c`& options
can be combined with &`/h`& to specify end or centre alignment at the halfway
position, respectively. If no notes follow the text string in the bar, &`/h`&
has no effect, and it is also ignored if &`/bar`& or &`/ts`& are present.
Positions other than the halfway point can be specified by a number given after
&`/h`&. For example, &`/h0.75`& specifies the three-quarter point between the
next note or rest and the one following. The &`/h`& option can be used with
underlay and overlay strings, but it applies only to the first syllable of such
strings.

.index "MusicXML" "offset positioning (string)"
The alignment point can also be positioned with respect to the musical offset
in the bar. This is similar to the `offset' positioning that is used in
MusicXML. Whereas &`/l`& and &`/r`& specify a distance in points, &`/lc`& and
&`/rc`& specify a distance in crotchets. For example:
.code
"some text"/rc1 a b
.endd
The text in this example is aligned with the second crotchet instead of the
first. The value given may be fractional, for example:
.code
"some text"/rc0.5 a b
.endd
In this case the text is aligned with where a quaver that follows the first
note would be. This is not necessarily halfway between the notes when there are
other staves that contain different note lengths. If &`/rc`& is used on text
that precedes the final note of a bar, or if &`/lc`& is used on text that
precedes the first note of a bar, the distance is calculated from the default
note spacing.


.subsection "Enclosed text (boxed or ringed)"
.index "text" "enclosed"
.index "text" "boxed"
.index "text" "ringed"
The longer the string is, the more elliptical a ring will be. For a single
character, the ring is approximately circular. If the &`/box`&, &`rbox`&, or
&`/ring`& options are used with underlay or overlay, they apply to each
individual syllable.


.subsection "Text sizes" SUBSECTtextsizeoption
.index "text" "sizes"
.index "size" "of text"
The &`/s`& option refers to the sizes of text defined by the &%textsizes%&
header directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTtextsizes>>&); &`/s1`& specifies the first
size, &`/s2`& specifies the second size, and so on.
.code
"Some text string"/s2
.endd
This example uses the second size defined by &%textsizes%&. The default size
for text that is not underlay, overlay, or figured bass is the size set by the
&%[textsize]%& directive or, if that is not present, the first settable size.
Underlay, overlay, and figured bass have their own default sizes, set by the
&%underlaysize%&, &%overlaysize%&, and &%fbsize%& directives. The &`/s`& option
can, however, be used with underlay, overlay, and figured bass text to specify
a non-default size for an individual string.

As well as the 20 settable text sizes, there are 10 fixed sizes that cannot be
changed. The &`/S`& option is used to select one of these sizes. The following
are defined:

.itable none 0 0 2  20 left 50 right

.row &`/S1`&  "12 points"
.row &`/S2`&  "11 points"
.row &`/S3`&  "10 points"
.row &`/S4`&  "9 points"
.row &`/S5`&  "8 points"
.row &`/S6`&  "7 points"
.endtable
The remaining four are set to 10 points, but may be changed in future so should
not be used. These fixed sizes are provided for the use of the standard macro
packages, but are not restricted to them.


.subsection "Rotated text" SUBSECTrottext
.index "text" "rotated"
.index "rotated text"
.index "fonts" "rotating"
Stave text strings that are not underlay or overlay can be rotated through any
angle by following the string with &`/rot`& and a number in degrees. Positive
rotation is anticlockwise.
.code
"gliss"/rot40/a0/r4 c'_/g [space 8] c''
.endd

.music "music41" 32 8,-22

The centre of rotation is on the text baseline, at the left-hand end of the
string. If the string is centred or right-aligned (the &`/c`&, &`/cb`&, or
&`/e`& options), this position is computed from the length of a horizontal
string, before rotation. That is, rotation happens last.


.subsection "Follow-on text" SUBSECTfollowon
.index "text" "follow-on"
.index "follow-on text"
By default, a string that immediately follows another string is placed above
or below the previous string and may have its own horizontal positioning. There
is, however, a facility for horizontally concatenating two or more strings.
This is useful when the strings use fonts of different sizes, or are rotated by
different amounts. Follow-on strings are characterised by the &`/F`& qualifier.

The first string and any follow-on strings must not use the &`/box`& or
&`/ring`& qualifiers. The first string may use any of the available positioning
qualifiers, but a follow-on string must not have any explicit positioning
qualifiers such as &`/a`&, or &`/ts`&. The starting point for a follow-on
string is the endpoint of the preceding string. The only qualifiers that are
permitted for follow-on strings are those for relative movement (&`/u`&,
&`/d`&, &`/l`&, &`/r`&), &`/s`& or &`/S`& to select a font size, and &`/rot`&
to specify a text rotation. A follow-on string that follows a rotated string
starts from the rotated end point. Here are some silly examples (text size 2 is
defined as 14 points):

.code
"small"/a " BIG "/s2/F "small"/F a
"square" "square"/F/rot270
"square"/F/rot180 "square"/F/rot90 a
.endd

.music "music60" 80 20,10



.section "Fingering indications" SECTfingeringindics
.index "fingering indications"
The small caps feature of text strings is useful for selecting a smaller than
normal font for fingering indications. Alternatively, a specific font size can
be defined and used with the &`/s`& text qualifier, or one of the fixed sizes
can be selected by &`/S`&. The music font contains the special characters
&{&#97;}&&~&~ and &{&#98;}&&~&~ for indicating the use of the thumb in cello
parts. The use of macros is suggested when setting music with lots of
fingering, and a suggested set of macros is provided in the &%Fingering%&
standard macro file (&R; &<<SECTfingeringmacros>>&). Note the use of the &`/c`&
option in this example, to centre the text below each note:
.code
*define 1 "\rm\\sc\1"/b/c
*define 2 "\rm\\sc\2"/b/c
*define 3 "\rm\\sc\3"/b/c
*define 4 "\rm\\sc\4"/b/c
[stave 1 alto]
&1 d- &3 c'= &2 b=; &4 d'- &3 f-;
&1 d= &2 b= &3 f= &4 d'=; &2 b= &3 f= &1 d- |
.endd

.music "music45" 32 8,-18



.section "Rehearsal marks" SECTrehearse
.index "rehearsal marks"
Rehearsal marks are specified as text items enclosed in square brackets. The
text may be longer than one character. It is output above the stave, and by
default is in bold type and enclosed in a rectangular box with mitred corners.
The &%rehearsalmarks%& directive can be used to change the size and the font,
to specify round corners for the box, or to specify a ring instead of a box, or
to specify no enclosure at all. If necessary, a rehearsal mark can be moved up,
down, left or right, in the same manner as other text. However, any other
options that are given with the string are ignored (with a warning).
.code
["A"/u2]
.endd
This example moves the mark two points upwards. Normally, a rehearsal mark is
given at the start of a bar, and in this case it is immediately to the right of
the preceding bar line when the bar is not the first in a system (that is, not
the first in a line). At the start of the first bar in a system, a rehearsal
mark is by default aligned with the first note in the bar, but the
&%rehearsalmarks%& directive can be used to move it to the left edge of the
system instead. If a rehearsal mark is given in the middle of a bar, it is
aligned horizontally with the next note, exactly as for other text.

Rehearsal marks normally appear above the top stave of a score only, though in
very large scores they are sometimes repeated part of the way down. If parts
are to be extracted from a score, the rehearsal marks should be specified on
stave 0 (&R; &<<SECTstave0>>&), so that they are always shown above the top
stave, whichever staves are selected.




.section "Vocal underlay and overlay text (lyrics)" SECTunderlay
.index "text" "underlay"
.index "underlay"
.index "overlay"
.index "multi-syllable underlay"
.index "underlay" "multi-syllable"
.index "underlay" "special characters"
PMW supports both underlay (words under the stave) and overlay (words over the
stave). Overlay is comparatively rare, and to save clumsy repetition of
`underlay or overlay' in what follows, the description is written mainly in
terms of underlay. However, all the features are equally applicable to overlay.
A text string is marked as underlay or overlay either by using the &`/ul`& or
&`/ol`& options, or by using the &%[text]%& directive to set underlay or
overlay as the default, and then not using any of the other text type options
(&`/a`&, &`/b`&, etc.) The usual escape character conventions apply, and in
addition, the characters &`#`& (sharp), &`-`& (hyphen), &`=`& (equals), and
&`^`& (circumflex) have special meanings. If you actually need one of these
characters as a literal, you need to escape it with a backslash.


.subsection "Underlay syllables"
Underlay can be input one syllable at a time, each syllable preceding the note
to which it refers. This gives the maximum possible control, because each
syllable can be moved up, down, left or right as required. However, it is
normally easier to input underlay in longer strings. If a string of underlay
text contains space and/or hyphen characters, it is automatically split up by
PMW and allocated to the notes that follow. However, after an occurrence of the
&%[reset]%& or &%[backup]%& directives (&R; &<<SUBSECTreset>>&,
&<<SUBSECTbackup>>&), distribution of underlay syllables is suspended until the
overprinting notes or rests have reached the reset/backup point. In the
following example, the words `brown fox' are associated with the final two
crotchets in the bar.
.code
"The quick brown fox"/ul gg [reset] eeee |
.endd
Rests are excluded from the underlay distribution process (with one exception,
which is described in section &<<SUBSECTuolayother>>&). A simple underlay
example is shown in chapter &<<CHAPfirstintro>>&.

.index "- (hyphen) in underlay string"
.index "hyphen" "in underlay string"
.index "strings" "hyphen in underlay"
Hyphens are used to indicate that a multi-syllable word is to associated with
several notes. All but the final syllable must end with a hyphen. This applies
however the input is supplied &-- either as a separate syllable for each note
or as a longer string that PMW splits up. PMW uses one or more hyphens in the
output, depending on the distance between the syllables. The header directive
&%hyphenthreshold%& can be used to specify the distance between syllables at
which more than one hyphen will be used. The default value is 50 points. If the
space is less than this, a single hyphen is used, centred in the space.
Otherwise, a number of hyphens appear, the distance between them being the
threshold value divided by three. PMW can alternatively use en-dash characters
(or any other characters) as `hyphens' between syllables of underlaid text. See
the &%hyphenstring%& header directive for details. Whatever is output, the
syllable separator in the input remains a single hyphen.

PMW does not check that the number of syllables matches the number of notes,
except that it warns if text is left over at the end of the stave. Each
syllable of underlay text is normally centred horizontally about the next note
in the bar. Sometimes it is necessary to move syllables slightly to the left or
right. A convenient way to do this is to include the character &`#`&
.index "# character in underlay"
in the underlay string. This character is output as a space, but does not count
as a space when PMW is splitting up the text. The width of a space is half the
size of the font.
.code
"Where# hast #tha" c' g-.a= |
.endd
If the default, 10-point font is in use, this example outputs `Where' 2.5
points to the left of where it would otherwise appear, and `tha' 2.5 points to
the right.
.index "underlay" "syllable alignment"

.index "# character in underlay"
.index "^ character" "in underlay"
.index "circumflex" "in underlay"
Sometimes several words are required to appear under a single note, and only
the first is to be centred on it. The &`#`& character can be used to separate
such words, to prevent them being assigned to separate notes. If the character
&`^`& (circumflex) appears in an underlay syllable, only those characters to
the left of it are counted when the string is being centred. The circumflex
itself is not output.
.code
"Glory^#be#to#Thee, O God." G+ g #F
.endd
In this example, the words `Glory be to Thee' are all associated with the
semibreve, but because of the circumflex, only `Glory' is centred under it, and
the rest stick out to the right. If a syllable starts with a circumflex, it is
not centred, but instead starts at the note position. If two circumflex
characters are present in a syllable, the text between them is centred at the
note position. This makes it possible to cause text to stick out to the left of
a note.

.index "underlay" "extension"
When a syllable extends over more than one note, equals characters must be
inserted into the input string, one for each extra note. This includes tied
notes, because PMW does not distinguish between ties and short slurs.
.code
"glo-==ri-a" F. | B`. | C. | E. | F. |
"glo-========ri-a" a-e-a- | b-c'=b=a=b= | c'- c'- b- |
.endd
There must not be any space characters between the end of a syllable and any
following equals. If the final syllable of a word is followed by one or more
equals characters, PMW automatically draws an extender line that finishes
underneath the last note, provided that the line is of reasonable length. The
vertical position of the extender level is just below the baseline of the text,
but this can be altered (&R; &<<SECTextlevel>>&). By default, PMW centres all
underlay and overlay syllables at the position of their respective notes. The
&%underlaystyle%& directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTunderlaystyle>>&) can be used to
request PMW to align underlay and overlay multinote syllables flush left with
the initial note. The circumflex character can still be used to specify that
particular multinote syllables be centred.

Text for two or more verses can be specified in multi-syllable fashion before
the relevant notes by giving each verse as a separate string.
.code
"With-in the wood-lands, flow'r-y gladed"
"When leaves that late-ly were a-spring-ing"
"Let other folk make mon-ey fast-er"
d-; g-a- | b d' e'-d'- | c b
.endd
The vertical distance between verses can be altered by means of the
&%underlaydepth%& and &%overlaydepth%& directives, which control independent
values. For overlay, the second verse is placed above the first one, and so
on. If any positioning qualifiers are specified on an underlay input string
(&`/u`&, &`/d`&, &`/l`&, or &`/r`&), the same amount of movement applies to
each of the syllables in the string independently. Specifying vertical movement
in this way can sometimes be a convenient alternative to the use of the
&%[ulevel]%& directive.

The multi-syllable underlay feature in PMW is just an alternative input
notation. The effect is exactly as if the individual syllables were input
immediately preceding the notes under which they appear. If an underlay
string ends with a hyphen, the equals characters can be omitted; PMW
automatically outputs a sequence of hyphens up to the next underlay syllable.
This can be useful when syllables last for many notes, for example:
.code
"glo-" g=a=b=g=; a=b=c'=a=; b-. "ri-a" g= b
.endd

.music "music23" 40 4,-12

If the final syllable of a word extends over many notes, only a single equals
character is needed if it is at the end of an input string. However, because
extender lines are drawn only as far as the last note for the syllable, rather
than to the next underlaid word, it is necessary to supply the final equals
character at the start of the next string, to tell PMW which is the final note
for the syllable.
.code
"long=" b=a=g=a=; b=a=g=a=; "= time" g g
.endd

.music "music32" 40 4,-12

If there are more notes on the stave, but no more words, a syllable consisting
of just a &`#`& character can be used to stop PMW drawing an extender line
further than is required.

&*Warning 1*&: The shortcuts for omitting equals characters should not be
relied on when there is more than one underlay verse because it may not be
clear which string belongs to which verse.

&*Warning 2*&: There is an important restriction on the use of multi-syllable
underlay text strings. Because they are processed during the input stage of
PMW, they cannot in general be used successfully with the square bracket
notation for repeating bars. Each syllable in such a string is allocated to
&'the next note read from the input'&, but a bar repeat count just duplicates
the bar in which it appears, without reading any more notes.
.index "strings" "underlay with bar repetition"
.index "repetition" "repeated bar with underlay"
However, if you use the string repetition feature (&R;
&<<SUBSECTstringrepetition>>&) to repeat the bar's input characters, this
problem does not arise.
.display
&`"one two three four"/ul &&*2(ab|)  `&this works as expected
&`"one two three four"/ul [2] ab |  `&this does not
.endd


.subsection "Underlay and overlay fonts"
.index "fonts" "underlay"
.index "underlay" "fonts"
.index "fonts" "overlay"
Two separate sets of fonts are provided for underlaid and overlaid text, and
the size of these can be set independently of the other text fonts by the
&%underlaysize%& and &%overlaysize%& directives. Individual underlay or overlay
strings can specify different sizes by means of the &`/s`& or &`/S`& qualifier.


.subsection "Underlay and overlay levels"
.index "underlay" "level"
.index "level" "of underlay"
Text that is marked as part of the underlay or overlay is always positioned at
the same level below or above the stave in any one system of staves; the line
of words is always horizontal. PMW chooses an underlay and an overlay level for
each line of music according to the notes that appear on that line, but these
can be overridden by means of the &%[ulevel]%& and &%[olevel]%& directives.
Individual words or syllables can be moved up or down relative to the standard
level by means of the &`/u`& and &`/d`& qualifiers.



.subsection "Underlay and overlay spreading"
.index "underlay" "note spreading"
.index "notes" "spreading for underlay"
PMW spreads out the notes of a piece to take into account the
width of underlaid or overlaid words. This facility should be used with care,
because the music can become very poorly spaced if the width of the words is
allowed to have too much influence on the separation of the notes. The
spreading facility operates only within individual bars, and not between bars.
It applies only to underlay or overlay text, not to other kinds of text. `Hard
spaces' (notated by sharp sign characters) in the text are included when
examining the available space. The minimum space allowed between syllables is
one space character in the appropriate font.

There is a header directive, &%nospreadunderlay%&, which disables this
facility for both underlay and overlay, and it is recommended that those who
place great importance on the spacing of notes should use it. The automatic
facility is intended as an insurance for less demanding users against the
occasional wide syllable. In order that it function in this way, it is
important that a suitable note spacing be set, and a suitable size of underlay
or overlay font be chosen, such that most of the syllables fit on the line
without the need for any adjustment of the notes. The default setup is not
always suitable for music with words; multiplying the note spacing by 1.2 and
choosing a font size of 9.5 usually gives better results.

&*Warning:*& If use of the &%layout%& header directive (&R;
&<<SUBSECTlayout>>&) causes the bars in a system to be horizontally compressed
in order to fit them on the line, underlaid syllables may be forced into each
other, even though they were originally separate. Although some re-spacing is
done after a sufficiently large compression, in order to mitigate this problem,
it is best to avoid settings of &%layout%& that cause compression if possible.


.subsection "Other uses of underlay and overlay" SUBSECTuolayother
.index "underlay" "use for other text"
The underlay and overlay facilities can be used for things other than the words
of a vocal part. It is common, for example, for the word &'crescendo'& to be
stretched out, in the style of underlay, or alternatively, for an abbreviation
such as &'cresc.'& to be followed by a number of hyphens. In the latter case,
the final `syllable' of the word does not exist, but it can be specified as a
single sharp character, which does not cause anything to be shown (because # is
output as a space in underlay). The text can be given as a single string, with
equals characters for each note under which hyphens are to be drawn, or each
syllable can be given with the relevant note. In the latter style, the final
syllable can be moved left or right to adjust the end point of the hyphens.
Here is a simple example of both kinds of approach:
.code
"\it\cresc-==en-==do"/ul gc'ga | gfgr |
"\it\dim.-"/ul gfef | G "#"/ul/r6 G |
.endd

.music "music24" 40 4,-10

PMW supports multiple verses, so there is no difficulty in mixing this kind of
usage with real vocal words, though usually the vocal line would be notated as
underlay and the other text as overlay. Underlay and overlay syllables cannot
normally be associated with rests, but because a final empty syllable is often
required when using underlay for rows of dashes, and ending at a rest is
common, an exception has been made for the string &`"#"`&, which should not
occur in normal underlay usage. If this string is specified as underlay or
overlay, and immediately precedes a rest, it is associated with the rest rather
than the following note. This exception applies only to strings consisting of a
single &`#`& character.

Hyphen strings for underlay have the hyphens fairly far apart, and at varying
separations. Sometimes a more uniform hyphen separation is required, and some
editors prefer some other character to the hyphen after items like &'cresc'&.
Some additional features are provided for use in these cases. If a second
string is provided as an option to an underlay or overlay string, separated by
a slash, it is used instead of hyphens between the syllables of a word. The
string is repeated as many times as possible in the available space. This
option should be given after any other options for the main string; in
particular it must follow an explicit &`/ul`& or &`/ol`& option.

The default font for the second string is the default underlay or overlay font,
as appropriate, and the default size is the size of the first string. However,
the second string may be followed by &`/s`& or &`/S`& and a number to specify a
different size. The second string may also be followed by &`/u`& or &`/d`& to
specify that it is to be moved up or down, relative to the following syllable.
In this example, a space and a full stop is used as the repeating string, and
it is moved up so as to be approximately at the middle of the letters.
.code
"\it\cresc.-"/ul/" ."/u1.5  gc'ga | gf "#"/ul gr |
.endd

.music "music25" 32 4,-16

The second string is a normal PMW string, and may contain font changes and
other escape sequences. Hence it can be used for trill signs followed by wiggly
lines, by selecting the appropriate characters from the music font.
.code
"\*136\-"/ol/"\*96\" E'+_ | "#"/ol/r8 E'R |
.endd
.index "trill" "with wiggly line"

.music "music26" 32 4,-22

Character 136 is the &{&#136;}& character, and character 96 is the tilde
&{&#96;zzz}&, which gives a wiggly line when repeated. The invisible final
syllable is moved right eight points to ensure that the wiggly line covers the
final note. If such features are required in several places in a piece, the
best thing to do is to use the macro facility to save having to type the
complicated strings each time. This approach is taken in the next example.

.index "8va"
.index "octave marks"
The conventional octave mark of &'8va'& followed by a line of dashes can be
handled using an overlay string. However, it is normal to have a small `jog' on
the final dash to indicate the end of the section. To achieve this, an
additional feature is available. If an underlay or overlay option string
contains a vertical bar character, only those characters to the left of the
vertical bar are used as the repeating sequence, but the characters to the
right of the bar are output at the end of the sequence, once. (If, by some
chance, a real vertical bar is required to be repeated, it must be escaped with
a backslash.) There are some angle-shaped characters in the music font that can
be used for the `jogs'.
.code
*define s8 "\it\8va-"/ol/" -| \mf\\159\"/u0.3
*define e8 "#"/ol/r8
&s8 c'.d'-e'd' | g'g' &e8 G' |
.endd

.music "music27" 30 4,-22

In this example, the macros &%s8%& and &%e8%& contain the strings needed to
start and end an &'8va'& mark, respectively. Notice that &%e8%& is used
before the final note under the mark. The repeated character string is a space
and a hyphen (specified before the vertical bar), and at the end, a space
followed by character 159 from the music font is output.

One further feature is available to cope with repeated strings that extend over
the end of a music system. If yet another optional string is given, it is
output at the start of each continuation line, before the start of the
repeating strings. The only option permitted after this string is &`/s`& or
&`/S`&, to set its size (which defaults to the size of the original underlay or
overlay string). Using this feature to output a small `8' at the start of
continuation lines, the macro definition from the above example becomes:
.code
*define s8 "\it\8va-"/ol/" -| \mf\\159\"/u0.3/"\it\8"/s2
.endd
This assumes that size 2 is suitably defined using the &%textsizes%& directive.

.chapter "Stave directives" CHAPstavedirectives
.index-from I07 "directives" "stave"
.index-from I08 "stave directives"
This chapter describes the directives that can appear interspersed with the
notes and rests of a stave. They must be enclosed in square brackets, though
more than one may appear within a single set of brackets. There are three other
items that can appear between square brackets: repeated expression marks (&R;
&<<SECTrepexpr>>&), repeated bar counts (&R; &<<SECTrepeatbars>>&), and
rehearsal marks (&R; &<<SECTrehearse>>&).


.section "Clef directives" SECTclef
.index "clefs" "list of"
Clefs are specified by directives that are the names of the clefs. There are
two different styles for C and F clefs, controlled by the &%clefstyle%&
directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTclefstyle>>&). The following clefs are available:

.itable none 0 0 2  100 left 300 left
.row &`alto`&           "C3"
.row &`baritone`&       "F3"
.row &`bass`&           "F4"
.row &`cbaritone`&      "C5"
.row &`contrabass`&     "F4 with &'8'& below"
.row &`deepbass`&       "F5"
.row &`hclef`&          "percussion H clef"
.row &`mezzo`&          "C2"
.row &`noclef`&         "nothing"
.row &`soprabass`&      "F4 with &'8'& above"
.row &`soprano`&        "C1"
.row &`tenor`&          "C4"
.row &`treble`&         "G2"
.row &`trebledescant`&  "G2 with &'8'& above"
.row &`trebletenor`&    "G2 with &'8'& below"
.row &`trebletenorb`&   "G2 with &'(8)'& below"
.endtable

.music "music42" 40 4,-14

The last two clefs shown are the alternative forms for C and F clefs.
&%[hclef]%& and &%[noclef]%& behave like a treble clef for note pitch and
positioning. If a clef directive is given without an argument, no change is
made to the current default octave. However, the directive name may be followed
by a number to indicate a new setting for the current octave.
.code
[treble 1]
.endd
This example sets the default octave to start at middle C. A clef setting has
no bearing on the interpretation of the pitch of the notes that go to make up a
part (apart from the octave setting). Changing the clef directive at the start
of a part causes the music to be output in the new clef, but at the same
absolute pitch as before. Clef changes in the middle of a stave that are not in
the middle of a bar are normally notated immediately before a bar line rather
than immediately after. The &%clefsize%& header directive is used to specify
the size of such clefs.



.section "Alphabetical list of stave directives" SECTstavedirectives
The stave directives are now described in alphabetical order.

.subsection "[1st], [2nd], etc." SUBSECTfirstsecond
.index "first time bar"
.index "second time bar"
First and second time bars (and third and fourth, etc. if needed) are specified
by enclosing the number, followed by one of the sequences `st', `nd', `rd' or
`th' in square brackets at the start of a bar. The mark for the final one is
terminated by the appearance of the directive &%[all]%&.
.code
[1st] g a b g :) | [2nd] g a b c' | [all] b a g f
.endd
There is an example of the output in section &<<SECTrepeats>>&. More than one
bar of music may appear between the items. The &%[all]%& directive is not used
if the piece ends with the second time bar. Often these marks are shown only
above the top stave of a score. If parts are to be extracted from a score,
first and second time marks should be specified on stave 0 (&R;
&<<SECTstave0>>&), so that they will be output above the top stave, whichever
staves are selected.

It is possible to specify vertical movements for 1st and 2nd time bar marks,
to cope with unusual cases. This is done by entering &`/u`& or &`/d`&, followed
by a number, in the directive. The left-hand ends of these marks can also be
moved left and right by means of &`/l`& and &`/r`& qualifiers.
.code
[1st/u4]
.endd
This example specifies a first time bar whose mark is to be 4 points higher
than it would be by default. PMW normally puts the second time mark at the same
level as the first, unless high notes in the second time bar force it upwards.
More than one of these marks can be given in the same bar.
.code
[1st] [2nd] Grg :) | [3rd] GR |
.endd
When this is done, the numbers are output with a comma and a space between
them. Any movement qualifiers must be specified on the first number. It is also
possible to change the text that is output by supplying a text string after a
slash.
.code
[1st/"primero"]
.endd
If there are several marks in the same bar, separate strings can be supplied
for each of them. The font size is set by the &%repeatbarfont%& directive,
which also sets the default font.


.subsection "[All]"
See the immediately preceding section.


.subsection "[Alto]"
.index "&%[alto]%&"
This specifies a C clef with its centre on the third stave line (&R;
&<<SECTclef>>&).


.subsection "[Assume]"
.index "&%[assume]%&"
.index "clefs" "assuming"
When an overprinted stave contains a sequence of skipped bars (see &%[skip]%&),
the clef, key signature, or time signature for its partner stave may have
changed before the skipping stave resumes. The &%[assume]%& directive can be
used to set these things without causing anything to be output.
.code
[skip 60] [assume bass 0] gbc |
.endd
This example has the effect of changing the stave into the bass clef so that
`gbc' are output in this clef, and a bass clef is shown at the next start of
line, but no clef is output where the directive occurs. Similar syntax is used
for setting the key and the time.
.code
[assume key E$]
[assume time 3/4]
.endd
The use of this directive is not confined to overprinted staves.


.subsection "[Backup]" SUBSECTbackup
.index "&%[backup]%&"
.index "overprinting" "previous note"
This directive moves the musical position in the bar back to that of the
previous note, thus allowing the previous note to be overprinted. To overprint
a whole bar, see &%[reset]%& (&R; &<<SUBSECTreset>>&), and to overprint a whole
stave, use another stave with zero stavespacing (&R;
&<<SUBSECTstavespacing>>&). &%[Backup]%& is an alternative to &%[reset]%&
followed by invisible rests, but is not exactly equivalent:

.ilist
After &%[reset]%& the state of the implied accidentals (relevant for MIDI
output) is re-initialized from the key signature, whereas there is no change
for &%[backup]%&.
.next
&%[Backup]%& is permitted inside irregular note groups such as triplets,
provided that it follows at least one note, whereas &%[reset]%& is not allowed.
.endlist
Here's an example of the use of &%[backup]%& to create a non-standard shorthand
for a minim that is to be played as four quavers. A macro is used to
demonstrate how this can be packaged for multiple uses.

.code
*define X() &&1-\nz\[backup]&&1+
[stave 1 treble 1]
&X(g) #&X(g)\>\ &X(c')
.endd

.music "music71" 36 4,-18

The argument of the macro is a note letter with an optional octave indication.
This is first output as a quaver without a notehead (using &`\nz\`&), followed
by an overprinted minim, which is coded as a doubled crotchet so that a single
lower case letter can be used for both notes. Note that the shorter of the two
notes is given first so that the whole item has the length of a minim. Note
also that an accidental may precede the whole item, and note options may
follow.


.subsection "[Baritone]"
.index "&%[baritone]%&"
This specifies an F clef based on the third stave line (&R; &<<SECTclef>>&).



.subsection "[Barlinestyle]"
.index "&%[barlinestyle]%&"
This directive must be followed by a number, and it sets the bar line style for
subsequent bar lines in the stave (&R; &<<SUBSECTbarlinestyle>>&).


.subsection "[Barnumber]" SUBSECTstavebarno
.index "&%[barnumber]%&"
.index "bar numbers" "requesting"
.index "bar numbers" "suppressing"
.index "bar numbers" "moving"
.index "bar numbers" "forcing"
.index "numbering bars"
The header directive &%barnumbers%& (&R; &<<SUBSECTheadbarno>>&) is used to
request automatic bar numbering. The stave directive &%[barnumber]%& is used to
control bar numbering for individual bars. If &%[barnumber]%& appears without
any arguments, a number is output for the current bar, independently of the
overall setting. This is the only way to generate a number with a fractional
part for an uncounted bar, or to generate a number for bar 1, which is not
normally numbered. The size of font used and whether or not the number is
enclosed in a box or ring is controlled by the header directive. The default is
not to use boxes, and the default size is 10 points.

The position of the bar number can be altered by following the directive with a
slash, one of the letters &`l`&, &`r`&, &`u`&, or &`d`&, and a number. This is
sometimes necessary when there are notes on high ledger lines at the start of a
numbered bar.
.code
[barnumber/l10/d5]
.endd
This example outputs a number on the current bar, 10 points to the left and 5
points down from where it would appear by default. If &%[barnumber]%& appears
followed by the word `off', no bar number is output for the current bar, even
if the header directive implies there should be one.


.subsection "[Bass]"
.index "&%[bass]%&"
This specifies a bass clef, that is, an F clef on the fourth stave line (&R;
&<<SECTclef>>&).


.subsection "[Beamacc]"
.index "&%[beamacc]%&"
This directive causes the next beam to be drawn as an accelerando beam (&R;
&<<SUBSECTaccritbeams>>&).


.subsection "[Beammove]"
.index "&%[beammove]%&"
.index "beaming" "moving a beam"
This directive, which takes a single number as its argument, causes the
following beam to be moved vertically without altering its slope. A positive
number moves it upwards, and a negative one downwards. An attempt to move a
beam too near the noteheads may give strange results. Use of this directive is
preferable to adjusting the stem length of one or more notes in the beam,
because it is not always clear which notes in the beam are those whose stems
control the beam position.


.subsection "[Beamrit]"
.index "&%[beamrit]%&"
This directive causes the next beam to be drawn as an ritardando beam (&R;
&<<SUBSECTaccritbeams>>&).


.subsection "[Beamslope]"
.index "&%[beamslope]%&"
.index "slope of beams"
.index "beaming" "slope"
PMW contains rules for choosing the slope of a beamed group which usually have
the right effect. However, it is possible to override them by means of the
&%[beamslope]%& stave directive. This directive takes as its argument a number
specifying the slope of the next beamed group on the current stave.
.code
[beamslope 0.2] g-g-
[beamslope 0] c-g-
[beamslope -0.1] g-c'-
.endd
Positive slopes go upwards to the right, negative ones downwards. A slope of
zero specifies a horizontal beam. The values given are in the conventional form
for gradients, with a slope of 1.0 giving an angle of 45 degrees. When a beam's
slope is specified explicitly, this overrides the setting of the maximum beam
slope (see &%maxbeamslope%&). When a beam has notes on either side of it, it
may not be possible to use the specified slope because of the position of the
notes. In this case, the default rules come into play again and a smaller slope
is chosen.


.subsection "[Bottommargin]"
.index "&%[bottommargin]%&"
.index "page" "bottom margin"
.index "margin" "bottom"
This directive provides a way of changing the value given by the
&%bottommargin%& header directive for a single page only. If there is more
than one occurrence on the same page, the last value is used.
.code
[bottommargin 30]
.endd
This example, which may appear in any bar on the page, sets the margin for that
page to 30 points.


.subsection "[Bowing]"
.index "&%[bowing]%&"
.index "bowing marks"
String bowing marks are normally output above the stave. The &%[bowing]%&
directive is provided for changing this. It must be followed by one of the
words `above' or `below'.


.subsection "[Breakbarline]"
.index "&%[breakbarline]%&"
An occurrence of this directive causes the bar line at the end of the current
bar not to be extended downwards onto the stave below, unless it is at the end
of a system. See also &%[unbreakbarline]%&.


.subsection "[Cbaritone]"
.index "&%[cbaritone]%&"
This specifies a C-clef on the 5-th stave line (&R; &<<SECTclef>>&).


.subsection "[Comma]"
.index "&%[comma]%&"
.index "pause" "comma"
The &%[comma]%& directive inserts a comma &+[&{zzz&#78;}&]+& pause mark above
the current stave. See also &%[tick]%&.


.subsection "[Contrabass]"
.index "&%[contrabass]%&"
This specifies a bass clef with a little `8' below it (&R;
&<<SECTclef>>&).


.subsection "[Copyzero]"
.index "&%[copyzero]%&"
.index "stave zero"
This directive takes a dimension as an argument, and adjusts the vertical level
of any stave zero material in the current bar when stave zero (&R;
&<<SECTstave0>>&) is overprinting the current stave.
.code
[copyzero 4]
.endd
This example raises the stave zero material in the current bar by 4 points.
It is not necessary for there to be an instance of the &%copyzero%& header
directive specifying the current stave for &%[copyzero]%& to take effect. In
the default case, &%[copyzero]%& takes effect whenever the stave in which it
appears is the top stave of a system.

When first and second time bar marks are specified in stave zero, and there
is a need to adjust their height for certain staves, it should be noted that
the marks are drawn when the bar in which their end point is determined is
processed. Consequently, it is that bar in which &%[copyzero]%& should appear.
The same applies to slurs and lines (though they are rarely specified in stave
zero).


.subsection "[Couple]"
.index "&%[couple]%&"
.index "coupled staves"
.index "treble/bass coupling"
.index "bass/treble coupling"
.index "staves" "coupled"
A single music part, notated as one PMW stave, can be spread across two staves.
This is a common requirement in keyboard music. If &%[couple up]%& is given on
a bass clef stave, it specifies that notes higher than middle C should be
positioned on the stave above, which is assumed to be a treble clef stave.
Similarly, &%[couple down]%& couples a treble clef stave to the bass clef stave
below, and there is also &%[couple off]%& to terminate the coupling. A stave
can be coupled only one way at once. However, there is no reason why a pair of
staves should not both be simultaneously coupled to each other. An example of
coupling is given in section &<<SUBSECTcoupleintro>>&.

&*Warning 1:*& Coupling only works properly if the upper stave is using the
treble clef and the lower one is using the bass clef.

&*Warning 2:*& Coupling requires the spacing between the staves to be a
multiple of 4 points if it is to work properly in all circumstances. The
default spacing of 44 points satisfies this requirement.

Occasionally it is desirable to cause individual notes that would not normally
be positioned on the coupled stave to be moved onto it. A notation for this is
provided in the form of the &`\c\`& note option.
.code
[treble 1 couple down] g-e-c-\c\g`-
.endd
The middle C in this beam would normally remain on the original (upper) stave,
but the use of &`\c\`& forces it down onto the lower one. If the &`\c\`& option
is used when coupling is not in force, the note is coupled upwards if it is on
or above the centre line of the stave; otherwise it is coupled downwards. When
coupling is in force, there is a note option &`\h\`& (for `here') that prevents
a note that would normally move onto the other stave from doing so.


.subsection "[Cue]" SUBSECTcue
.index "&%[cue]%&"
.index "cue bars"
The directive &%[cue]%& causes the subsequent notes of the current bar, on the
current stave, to be output using the cue note font, instead of the normal
font. Typically, the note spacing needs to be reduced as well. This feature is
normally used only for single parts; the conditional features of PMW can be
used to control this, as in the following example:
.code
[35] R! |          @ 35 bars rest
*if score
  R! |             @ if full score, rest bar
*else
  [cue] [ns *1/2]  @ cue bar with halved note spacing
  "[flute]"/a      @ output above stave
  g a-g-f-e- e
  | [ns]           @ restore note spacing at next bar start
*fi                @ end conditional section
.endd
The effect of the &%[cue]%& directive is automatically cancelled at the end of
the bar in which it appears, but it can also be explicitly cancelled by
&%[endcue]%&.
.index "&%endcue%&"
.index "ornaments" "complicated"
In addition to their use for cue bars, &%[cue]%& and &%[endcue]%& can be used
for handling complicated ornaments or optional notes. Another way of handling
optional notes is to use the &`\sm\`& note option &R; &<<SUBSECTnoteheads>>&.)
.index "optional notes"
When cue notes are dotted, the dots are spaced horizontally in proportion to
the size of the cue notes. However, when there are small optional notes with
full-sized notes directly above or below on the same stave, it is sometimes
better to arrange for all the dots to be aligned. You can request this by
specifying &%[cue/dotalign]%&, which increases the space between the cue notes
and their dots.


.subsection "[Deepbass]"
.index "&%[deepbass]%&"
This specifies an F clef based on the fifth stave line (&R; &<<SECTclef>>&).


.subsection "[Dots]"
.index "augmentation dots" "inverted"
.index "&%[dots]%&"
Augmentation dots are normally put in the space above when a note appears
on a stave line. The directive &%[dots]%& is provided for changing this. It
must be followed by one of the words `above' or `below', and it applies to all
subsequent notes on the stave, with the exception of certain adjacent notes in
chords. Note that the position of an individual note's dot can be overridden by
means of the &`\:\`& note option (&R; &<<SUBSECTnoteexpr>>&).


.subsection "[Doublenotes]" SUBSECTstavedoublenotes
.index "&%[doublenotes]%&"
.index "doubling note lengths"
.index "notes" "doubling length"
This directive causes the length of subsequent notes in the current stave to be
doubled. Unlike the header directive with the same name (&R;
&<<SUBSECTdoublenotes>>&), it does not affect time signatures. It is, however,
cumulative with the header directive and with &%[halvenotes]%&
(&R; &<<SUBSECTstavehalvenotes>>&).


.subsection "[Draw]"
The &%[draw]%& directive is described in chapter &<<CHAPdraw>>&.


.subsection "[Endcue]"
See &%[Cue]%& (&R; &<<SUBSECTcue>>&) above.


.subsection "[Endline]"
See &%[line]%& (&R; &<<SUBSECTline>>&) below.


.subsection "[Endslur]"
See &%[slur]%& (&R; &<<SUBSECTslurs>>&) below.


.subsection "[Endstave]"
.index "&%[endstave]%&"
The data for each stave of music must end with the directive &%[endstave]%&.
This can be followed only by the start of a new stave or the start of a new
movement or by the end of the file.


.subsection "[Ensure]"
.index "&%[ensure]%&"
.index "spacing" "ensuring sufficient"
The &%[space]%& directive always inserts extra space before a note. Sometimes
all that is needed is an assurance that a certain amount of space is available,
for example, when using the drawing facilities for marks that PMW does not know
about. The &%[ensure]%& directive provides this facility. If the requested
amount of space is not available between the previous note (or the start of the
bar) and the next note (or the end of the bar), a suitable amount of space is
inserted.
.code
G [ensure 32] G
.endd
In this example, if this is the only stave, because minims are normally 20
points apart, the &%[ensure]%& directive has the effect of inserting 12 points
of space. However, if there is another stave containing four crotchets, which
are 16 points apart, there is already 32 points between the two minims, and no
extra space is inserted. The additional space is inserted immediately before
the note, thus moving it further away from any other items, such as clefs,
which may lie between it and the previous note.


.subsection "[Fbfont]"
.index "&%[fbfont]%&"
.index "fonts" "default for figured bass"
.index "figured bass" "default font"
The default typeface for figured bass text is roman. It can be changed for an
individual stave by means of the &%[fbfont]%& directive. This directive takes
as its argument one of the standard font names.
.code
[fbfont extra 3]
.endd
This example assumes that the third extra font has been suitably defined for
use in figured bass text. In any given text string it is always possible to
change typeface by using the appropriate escape sequence.


.subsection "[Fbtextsize]"
.index "&%[fbtextsize]%&"
This directive must be followed by a number in the range 1 to 20. It selects
the default size to be used for figured bass text on the current stave. The
actual font sizes that correspond to the twenty available sizes are set by the
&%textsizes%& header directive. If this directive is not used, the size used
is the one set by the &%fbsize%& header directive (which is a different
parameter from any of the sizes set by &%textsizes%&). &%[Fbtextsize]%& is
normally needed only if you want different sizes of figured bass text on
different staves.


.subsection "[Footnote]" SUBSECTfootnote
.index "&%[footnote]%&"
.index "footnotes"
This directive usually defines a text string that is output below the bottom
system of the page in which the current bar appears. However, the syntax of
&%[footnote]%& is the same as the syntax of the &%heading%& and &%footing%&
directives (&R; &<<SUBSECTheading>>&), and therefore &%[footnote]%& may
alternatively define a drawing. Footnotes are different from footings, in that
the space in which they are placed is taken from the normal page length;
consequently the bottom system of music is positioned higher up the page, in
order to leave room for footnotes. If a textual footnote is longer than the
line length, it is automatically split into several lines in the same was as
headings and footings.
.code
[footnote "A close friend of Schumann and Mendelssohn,
Sheffield-born Sterndale Bennett founded the Bach choir,
was for ten years the conductor of the Philharmonic Society,
and in 1866 became principal of the Royal Academy of Music."]
.endd
The initial font is roman, and the default size is 9 points, but this can be
changed by the &%footnotesize%& header directive. An individual footnote may
override the default by including a number before the text string. If there are
several footnotes on one page, extra vertical white space is left between them.
The default amount of extra space is 4 points, but this can be changed by the
&%footnotesep%& header directive. If there are several footnotes in one system,
they are ordered by stave, those for the lowest numbered stave appearing first.


.subsection "[Hairpins]" SUBSECThairpinsstave
.index "&%[hairpins]%&"
.index "hairpin position"
Hairpins (&R; &<<SECThairpins>>&) are normally placed below the stave. The
&%[hairpins]%& directive is provided for changing this for an individual stave.
It must be followed by one of the words `above' or `below'. It can also be
followed by `middle', which causes hairpins to be below the stave, half way
between it and the following stave, unless low notes on the upper stave force
them lower still. Hairpins in fixed positions above or below the stave can be
made the default by following `above' or `below' in the &%[hairpins]%&
directive by a dimension.
.code
[hairpins above 10]
.endd
This example specifies that the `sharp end' of hairpins should be positioned 10
points above the top of the stave. Individual hairpins can be moved from this
position by the normal &`/u`& and &`/d`& qualifiers on the angle bracket
characters that specify hairpins. In addition, &`/a`& and &`/b`& can be used
without a dimension to specify the default type of hairpin, whose vertical
position depends on the notes it covers. It is also possible to set up a
default adjustment for variable-position hairpins, by giving a dimension
preceded by &`+`& or &`-`& in the &%[hairpins]%& directive.
.code
[hairpins below -4]
.endd
After this example, all hairpins are positioned as if they were followed by
&`/d4`&. Note the distinction between these two directives:
.code
[hairpins above 8]
[hairpins above +8]
.endd
The former causes all hairpins to be 8 points above the stave, whereas the
latter adds 8 points to whatever position PMW computes from the notes under the
hairpin.


.subsection "[Hairpinwidth]"
.index "&%[hairpinwidth]%&"
This directive, which must be followed by a dimension, sets the default width
of the open ends of any subsequent hairpins on the current stave. The overall
default is 7 points. The width of the open end of an individual hairpin can be
set by following the initial &`<`& or &`>`& character with &`/w`& and a
dimension.


.subsection "[Halvenotes]" SUBSECTstavehalvenotes
.index "&%[halvenotes]%&"
.index "halving note lengths"
.index "notes" "halving length"
This directive causes the length of subsequent notes in the current stave to be
halved. Unlike the header directive with the same name (&R;
&<<SUBSECThalvenotes>>&), it does not affect time signatures. It is, however,
cumulative with the header directive and with &%[doublenotes]%&
(&R; &<<SUBSECTstavedoublenotes>>&). For example, if there are many bars
consisting mostly of quavers in a stave, using &%[halvenotes]%& saves having to
type hyphens after each lower case note letter. &%[Doublenotes]%& can be used
to restore the previous state.


.subsection "[Hclef]"
.index "&%[hclef]%&"
.index "percussion clef"
This directive causes a percussion `H-clef' to be used on the current stave.
This behaves as a treble clef as far as note positioning is concerned (&R;
&<<SECTclef>>&).


.subsection "[Justify]"
.index "&%[justify]%&"
The justification parameters can be changed by the appearance of this stave
directive. Unlike the header directive of the same name, it specifies
&'changes'& to the justification parameters, not complete settings. Its effect
lasts only until the end of the current movement. The directive name must be
followed by a &`+`& character (for adding a justification) or a &`-`& character
(for removing a justification) immediately preceding one of the words `top',
`bottom', `left', or `right'. For example, if the last page of a piece uses
only slightly more than half the page depth, and vertical justification is not
wanted, &%[justify -bottom]%& should be included in any bar on that page.
Changes of parameter take effect from the system in which they are encountered,
and persist until a subsequent change. More than one change may be given at
once.
.code
[justify -right -bottom]
.endd
This example might be used in the last system of a piece if the last line and
the last page are both too short to be sensibly justified.


.subsection "[Key]"
.index "&%[key]%&"
.index "key signatures" "changing"
This directive specifies a change of key signature. If this falls at the start
of a system, a cautionary key signature is output at the end of the previous
system unless the word `nowarn' is included in the directive.
.code
[key E$ nowarn]
.endd
There is also a header directive, &%nokeywarn%&, for suppressing all cautionary
key signatures. Key signature changes are shown in `modern style'. That is,
unless the new key signature is empty (C major, A minor, the pseudo-key N, or
an empty string from &%printkey%&), all that is output is the new signature.
If `old style' is required, where the new key signature is preceded by an
explicit cancelling of the old one with naturals, the new signature should be
preceded by a change to a key with an empty signature. For example, in the
default configuration (no &%printkey%& settings):
.code
[key C key A]
.endd
This example uses a number of naturals to cancel the previous signature before
outputting three sharps for A major. When a bar starts with a new key signature
and a repeat mark, the order in which these appear depends on their order in
the input.
.code
[key G] (:
.endd
This example causes the key signature to be first, followed by the repeat mark.
.code
(: [key G]
.endd
This example causes the repeat mark to be amalgamated with the previous bar
line, with the key signature following. If, at the same point in the music,
these items appear in different orders on different staves, the repeat sign is
put first on all staves.


.subsection "[Line]" SUBSECTline
.index "lines" "straight"
.index "straight lines"
.index "lines" "over notes"
.index "lines" "under notes"
.index "&%[line]%&"
.index "&%[xline]%&"
.index "bracket, horizontal"
.index "horizontal brackets"
There are a number of situations where it is required to draw a straight line
above or below a sequence of notes, with or without small `jogs' at the ends.
The directive &%[line]%& works exactly like &%[slur]%& (&R;
&<<SUBSECTslurs>>&) and internally shares the same code, except that what is
drawn is a straight line with a vertical `jog' on each end, giving a sort of
horizontal or near-horizontal bracket.

The angle of the line depends on the `shape' of the note sequence that
is above or below. The end of the line is marked by &%[endline]%& or &%[el]%&
and there are the same options as for &%[slur]%& &-- for example, &`/b`&,
&`/u`&, &`/d`&, &`/rr`&, etc. The &`/i`& and &`/ip`& qualifiers are available,
and cause a dashed or dotted line to be drawn, respectively. The &`/co`& and
&`/ci`& options affect the length of the `jogs'; however, the other options
starting with &`/c`&, which for a slur move the B&eacute;zier curve control
points, are ignored for lines. The following options can also be given with
&%[line]%& in addition to those available for &%[slur]%&:
.display
&`/ol`&   requests that the line be `open on the left'
&`/or`&   requests that the line be `open on the right'
.endd
An `open' line has no `jog' on the end. Unlike slurs, lines are by default
always positioned above or below the stave itself, never actually overprinting
it. However, like slurs, they can be positioned at fixed positions above or
below the staves or at the underlay or overlay levels. The fixed positions
refer to the main part of the line, excluding the jogs, if any. The
&%[linegap]%& directive can be used to leave gaps in lines with optional text
or drawing in the gap. For handling complicated overlapping lines, there is an
&%[xline]%& directive that corresponds to &%[xslur]%&, and lines can also be
`tagged' like slurs (&R; &<<SUBSECTtaggedslurs>>&). The &`/=`& option that is
used in &%[endslur]%& to identify tagged slurs is also available in
&%[endline]%& for tagged lines. Slurs and lines share the same name space for
tags.


.subsection "[Linegap]" SUBSECTlinegap
.index "&%[linegap]%&"
.index "gaps" "in lines"
.index "lines" "gaps in"
The directive &%[linegap]%& requests that a gap be left in a line that was set
up by the &%[line]%& directive. The following options are provided:
.ilist
&`/=`&<&'letter'&> is used to identify which line is being referenced, in
exactly the same way as it is used on the &%[endline]%& directive.
.next
&`/w`& followed by a number is used to specify the width of the gap; if it is
not given, a width of four points is used, unless there is an associated text
string (see below). The width is measured along the line. If a gap passes
either end of the line, the ending jog is never drawn, even if specified.
.next
&`/h`& specifies that the centre of the gap is to be halfway along the line. It
can be followed by a number in the range 0&--1.0 to specify a different
fraction of the length; for example, &`/h0.75`& specifies that the centre of
the gap is to be three-quarters of the way along the line. If &`/h`& is not
specified, the centre of the gap is aligned with the centre of the notehead of
the next note, or with the barline if there are no more notes in the bar.
If &`/h`& is used when a line is split between two systems, it is applied to
whichever part of the line the &%[linegap]%& directive falls in.
.next
&`/l`& and &`/r`& are used to move the position of the gap to the left or to
the right by a given number of points.
.next
.index "drawing facility" "in line gaps"
&`/draw`& <&'arguments'&> <&'name'&> specifies that the named drawing is to be
associated with the gap. &*Warning*&: take care not to leave out the &`/`& by
mistake. If a space is used instead, the drawing is no longer associated with
the line gap, but with the following note. When defining drawings that are to
be used with line gaps, it is useful to know that the width of lines drawn by
&%[line]%& is 0.3 points. The drawing code is obeyed with the origin of the
coordinate system set to the centre of the gap, and the variables &%linegapx%&
and &%linegapy%& containing the coordinates of the start of the right-hand
portion of the line relative to this origin. For a horizontal line,
&%linegapx%& is half the width of the gap, and &%linegapy%& is zero.
.next
.index "text" "in line gaps"
&`/"`&&'text'&&`"`& associates the text with the gap.
.code
[linegap/"\it\ad lib."]
.endd
This example outputs the italic text &'ad lib.'& in the gap. The default font
is roman. If no width for the gap is given by the &`/w`& option, the width is
set to the length of the text plus a little bit. The text is centred in the
gap, rotated so that it has the same slope as the line. The text option must be
the last option for &%[linegap]%& because any further options are taken as
options that apply to the string. The following text options are available:
&`/u`&, &`/d`&, &`/l`&, &`/r`&, &`/s`&, &`/S`&, &`/box`&, &`/rbox`&, and
&`/ring`&. The movements are relative to a coordinate system whose `horizontal'
axis lies on the line joining the ends of the gap.
.endlist

A drawing or text string can be associated with the start or end of a line by
using &`/h0`& or &`/h1`&, respectively. To associate a drawing or string with a
particular point on a line, but without leaving a gap, &`/w0`& can be used. Any
number of gaps may be specified for a single line. They are processed from left
to right, and all the drawings for a single line on one system are processed
together in succession. Here is an example of a gap that is used for some text
in the middle of a horizontal line:
.code
[line/a/h linegap/h/"unis. \it\ad lib"] efge | bag [el] r |
.endd

.music "music28" 36 4,-18

Because the &`/h`& option is used, the &%[linegap]%& directive can be given
right at the start of the line. Do not confuse &`/h`& as used with &%[line]%&,
where it means &'horizontal'&, with &`/h`& as used with &%[linegap]%&, where it
means &'halfway'&. This latter usage was chosen to be similar to the &`/h`&
option on hairpins.
.index "pedal marks"
Another use of the &%[linegap]%& facility is for drawing conventional piano
pedal marks. Because these appear often in a piece, it is sensible to
define macros for the relevant directives.
.code
draw blip
  linegapx linegapy moveto
  0 linegapx 2 mul lineto
  linegapx neg linegapy neg lineto
  0.3 setlinewidth stroke
enddraw

draw ped
  0 0 moveto "\**163\ " show
enddraw

*define ped  [line/=P/b/h/ol/d4 linegap/h0/w30/draw ped]
*define blip [linegap/=P/draw blip]
*define ep   [endline/=P]

[stave 1 bass 0]
r- &ped %a &blip b-_; b-; e &blip a`-_ | a`- G` &ep r-r |
.endd

.music "music29" 40 0,-12

The &%ped%& macro starts the line, which is specified as horizontal and open
(that is, no jog) on the left. It is also moved down four points, to allow for
the height of the &{{&#163;}}& text at the start, which is generated by the
immediately following &%[linegap]%& directive. The &%blip%& macro creates a gap
in the line at the next note, and causes a `blip' to be drawn. Notice that the
size of the blip is relative to the width of the gap. Thus the same drawing
could be used for different sized blips if required. The &%ep%& macro ends the
line. In simple cases it would be just as quick to type &%[el]%&, the
abbreviation for &%[endline]%&, but using the macro makes it clear that it is a
pedal line that is terminating as well as using the &`/=`& option to specify
exactly which line it is.


.subsection "[Mezzo]"
.index "&%[mezzo]%&"
This specifies a C clef with its centre on the second stave line (&R;
&<<SECTclef>>&).


.subsection "[Midichannel]" SUBSECTmidichannelST
.index "&%[midichannel]%&"
.index "MIDI" "changing channel"
The &%[midichannel]%& directive can be used to change the MIDI channel that the
current stave uses, from the next note onwards. It can also be used to change
the voice allocation of the new channel at the same time.
.code
[midichannel 5]
[midichannel 6 "flute"]
.endd
The voice change takes effect at the time of the next note (or rest), and of
course it affects any other staves that may be using the same channel.
A relative volume may optionally be given after the voice name, separated by a
slash.
.code
[midichannel 1 "trumpet"/12]
.endd
See the &%midichannel%& header directive for how to set up channels at the
start of a piece.


.subsection "[Midipitch]" SUBSECTmidipitch
.index "&%[midipitch]%&"
.index "MIDI" "changing pitch"
The &%[midipitch]%& directive is used to alter the MIDI playing pitch for a
stave, for the purpose of selecting a different untuned percussion instrument.
Its argument takes the same form as the final argument of the &%midichannel%&
header directive.
.code
[midipitch "bongo"]
.endd
To stop forcing the playing pitch on a stave, specify an empty string in
quotes. See &%[printpitch]%& for an alternative way of handling MIDI untuned
percussion.


.subsection "[Miditranspose]"
.index "&%[miditranspose]%&"
.index "transposition" "for playing"
The &%[miditranspose]%& directive can be used to change the playing
transposition of a stave, which is initially set from the &%miditranspose%&
header directive. The value given in &%[miditranspose]%& is added to the
current playing transposition for the stave at the point it is encountered. One
use of this is to arrange for &'8va'& passages to be played at the correct
pitch. Changes made by &%[miditranspose]%& do not persist beyond the end of the
movement.


.subsection "[Miditremolo]"
.index "&%[miditremolo]%&"
.index "MIDI" "changing tremolo"
This directive changes the MIDI tremolo setting for the current stave. Its
argument is one of the words `repeat', `trill', `both', or `none'. For more
details see the &%miditremolo%& header directive (&R;
&<<SUBSECTmiditremolo>>&), which sets the default for all staves.


.subsection "[Midivoice]" SUBSECTmidivoice
.index "&%[midivoice]%&"
.index "MIDI" "changing voice"
The &%[midivoice]%& directive can be used to change the MIDI voice without
changing the channel. Like &%[midichannel]%& a relative volume may optionally
be given after the voice name, separated by a slash.
.code
[midivoice "french horn"]
[midivoice "piano"/12]
.endd
Note that this will affect any other staves that are using the same channel. If
&%[midivoice]%& with different arguments appears in multiple staves that are
using the same channel, the result is undefined. If you want different staves
to play using different voices, you must allocate them to different channels,
using either &%midichannel%& at the start of the piece, or &%[midichannel]%& on
each stave.


.subsection "[Midivolume]" SUBSECTmidivolumeST
.index "&%[midivolume]%&"
.index "MIDI" "changing volume"
This directive can be used to change the relative MIDI playing volume of a
particular stave part way through. Its single argument is number between 0 and
15, specifying the new relative volume for the current stave.


.subsection "[Move]"
.index "&%[move]%&"
.index "moved notes"
.index "notes" "moved"
.index "clefs" "moving"
If the &%[move]%& directive is followed by a single number, it causes the next
non-textual thing on the current stave, whether it be a note or something else,
to be moved horizontally by that number of points, without affecting the
position of anything else in the bar, except slurs or ties that are attached to
a moved note and any accents or ornaments that a note may have. If the number
is positive, movement is to the right; if negative, it is to the left. Certain
items can also be moved vertically, by specifying a second number after a
comma. The second argument may also be a positive or negative number; positive
movement is upwards. If two or more &%[move]%& directives appear in succession
on a stave, they act cumulatively.
.code
[move -2,4 treble]
.endd
This example positions a mid-stave clef two points to the left and four points
higher than normal. Vertical movement does not apply to notes, and is ignored
if specified. It does apply to rests. See &%[rlevel]%& and section
&<<SUBSECTchrele>>& for other ways of moving rests vertically. If more than one
is used, the effect is cumulative.

When staves of different sizes are in use, any vertical movement specified by
&%[move]%& is scaled for the current stave, but horizontal movements are not
scaled. However, there is a related directive called &%[rmove]%& that scales in
both directions. Text items and slurs have their own movement options.

Those items to which the &%[move]%& directive applies are: clefs, key
signatures, time signatures, dotted bar lines, repeat marks, caesuras, commas,
ticks, rests, and notes (horizontal movement only). If &%[move]%& is present in
the first bar of a sequence of rest bars and they are packed up into a single
multi-bar rest, the &%[move]%& is applied to the number that is output above
the long rest sign. See also &%[ensure]%&, &%[rmove]%&, &%[rsmove]%&,
&%[rpace]%&, &%[smove]%& and &%[space]%&.


.subsection "[Name]" SUBSECTname
.index "&%[name]%&"
.index "naming staves"
.index "staves" "names for"
The &%[name]%& directive has two entirely separate functions. If its arguments
are one or more strings or calls to drawing functions, it is an alternative way
of defining text and/or drawings that appear at the left-hand side of the
stave. This can be useful when portions of the text are being skipped
conditionally.
.code
[stave 1 treble 1]
*if score
[name "Flute" "Fl."]
*fi
.endd
This example shows the name in the score, but not in the part. In this form,
the arguments for &%[name]%& are exactly the same as the text and drawing
arguments of the &%[stave]%& directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTstave>>&). Each
occurrence of &%[name]%& adds to the list of strings and drawings.

The second form of &%[name]%& is used to change what appears at the start of
a stave part-way through a piece, for example, if a double choir becomes a
single choir, or &'vice versa'&. In this usage, its argument is a single
number, which selects which string and/or drawing is to be used on the current
and subsequent systems. Each start-of-stave `item' consists of a string or a
call to a drawing function, or both, and the items are numbered starting at
one. For example, a stave might start with:
.code
[stave 2 "Alto" "A" "Alto I"]
.endd
By default in the first system the stave is labelled `Alto', and in all
subsequent systems it is by default labelled `A'. However, if &%[name 3]%& is
used at any point, the system in which it appears, and any subsequent ones,
use the text `Alto I' for this stave. A number greater than the number of
items can be used to suppress any output; alternatively, empty strings can be
used.


.subsection "[Newline]"
.index "&%[newline]%&"
.index "forcing new lines"
The directive &%[newline]%& can be used to force a new line (system) of music
to be started for a particular bar. It should normally be at the start of a
bar, but it need only appear in one stave that is selected. If a stave is not
selected, an appearance of &%[newline]%& within it is ignored. See also the
&%layout%& header directive.


.subsection "[Newmovement]" SUBSECTnewmovement
.index "&%[newmovement]%&"
.index "movement" "specifying"
This directive must appear either immediately after an &%[endstave]%&
directive, or in the header section of a movement. In the latter case it
terminates a movement that has no staves; this could be used for a title page.
There are a number of optional arguments, described below, of which
&`newpage`&, &`thispage`&, and &`thisline`& are mutually exclusive.

&%[Newmovement]%& is followed by a new set of header directives and stave data.
When it is used without an argument, PMW looks to see if it can fit the new
heading lines (if any) and the first system of the new movement onto the
current page. If it cannot, a new page is started. In the case of a system
consisting of one stave only, PMW tries to fit two systems into the current
page, because a single line of music at the bottom of a page does not look
good. By specifying &%[newmovement newpage]%& you can force PMW always to
start a new page. You can also specify &%[newmovement thispage]%& to stay
on the current page when only a single stave of music will fit.

Page headings specified in the new movement completely replace those set up in
the previous movement, but if nothing is specified, the old page headings
continue. This means that, for example, if page numbers are specified in the
first movement by a page heading, they are output on all subsequent pages,
including pages that are the start of new movements. Section
&<<SUBSECTmovement>>& contains more details about the interaction of headings
and footings with new movements.

When a new movement starts at the top of a page, any page headings that are in
force (either carried over or newly specified) are output, in addition to the
headings for the movement. Sometimes, however, it is required to suppress these
page headings, for example if they are being used to put the name of the
movement at the head of pages. This can be done by adding the keyword
`nopageheading' to the &%[newmovement]%& directive.
.code
[newmovement nopageheading]
.endd
This option can be used with or without the `newpage' option; it takes effect
only if the new movement actually starts at the top of a page.

.index "footing" "at end of movement"
The &%lastfooting%& directive sets up footings for the final page of a piece.
In some circumstances it may be desirable to have a special footing at the end
of an individual movement, and this can be done by specifying &%[newmovement
uselastfooting]%&. In this case, if the new movement starts on a new page, the
footing on the previous page is the &%lastfooting%& from the previous movement,
if present. To force a new page, putting the &%lastfooting%& text on the
current page, use:
.code
[newmovement newpage uselastfooting]
.endd
Use of this option does not cancel the &%lastfooting%& text; it is carried
forward to the new movement, but of course can be replaced by a new
&%lastfooting%& directive in the new movement.

Another possible form of the directive is &%[newmovement thisline]%&, which
is useful in some specialized circumstances. It has the effect of starting a
new movement without advancing the current vertical position on the page. If
there are no headings, the first system of the new movement's first stave is at
the same level as the first stave of the last system of the previous movement.
Two different uses are envisaged for this:
.ilist
Music for church services often contains very short sections of one or two
bars, and it is sometimes desirable to have two or more of them side by side.
.next
.index "incipits"
One style of incipit has white space between the incipit staves and the start
of the main system.
.endlist
In both cases it is necessary to specify left justification for the last system
of the first movement, and right justification for the first system of the
second.


.subsection "[Newpage]"
.index "&%[newpage]%&"
.index "forcing new pages"
The directive &%[newpage]%& can be used to force a new page of music to be
started at a particular point. It should always be at the start of a bar, but
need appear in only one stave. If a stave is not selected, however, an
appearance of &%[newpage]%& within it is ignored. See also the &%layout%&
header directive.


.subsection "[Nocheck]" SUBSECTstavenocheck
.index "&%[nocheck]%&"
.index "bar lengths"
.index "odd bar lengths"
.index "variable bar lengths"
It is sometimes useful to disable PMW's checking of bar lengths (at the start
or end of a piece, for example). The directive &%[nocheck]%& suppresses this
check, for the current bar only. (See the header directive of the same name
for suppressing the check globally.) You can omit &%[nocheck]%& from completely
empty bars and bars in which nothing appears other than a whole bar rest
indication.


.subsection "[Noclef]"
.index "&%[noclef]%&"
.index "invisible items" "clefs"
.index "clefs" "invisible"
This specifies an invisible clef (&R; &<<SECTclef>>&). It acts as a treble clef
as far as note pitch is concerned. It is useful when setting incipits where no
clef is required. It is also useful when setting fragments and musical
examples.


.subsection "[Nocount]"
.index "&%[nocount]%&"
.index "uncounted bars"
.index "bar numbers" "counting"
.index "counting bars"
.index "bar counting"
If the first bar of a piece is incomplete, it is conventional not to include it
in the bar numbering. Occasionally this applies in other situations, for
example, when using an `invisible bar line' to make PMW split a bar over two
systems. The directive &%[nocount]%& causes the current bar not to be counted;
such a bar is never numbered by the &%barnumbers%& header directive, but an
explicit &%[barnumber]%& within a stave is honoured (unless it is zero, the
number will have a decimal fraction). &%[Nocount]%& need appear in only one
stave. If it appears anywhere in a bar whose contents are repeated by means of
a number in square brackets, all the repeated bars are uncounted. Section
&<<SECTident>>& explains how PMW identifies uncounted bars if it needs to refer
to them, for example, in an error message.


.subsection "[Noteheads]" SUBSECTnoteheadstave
.index "&%[noteheads]%&"
.index "noteheads" "invisible"
.index "noteheads" "alternative shapes"
.index "shape of noteheads"
.index "invisible items" "noteheads"
.index "harmonics"
.index "`direct' character for noteheads"
.index "noteheads" "`direct' character"
.index "pitch, indicating without duration"
Four alternative notehead shapes are supported: diamond-shaped for string
harmonics, cross-shaped, circular, and invisible (that is, no noteheads at
all). The character &{{&#178;}}& (which is called `direct') is sometimes seen
on a stave in musical extracts and examination papers to indicate a pitch
without specifying a time value. This character is in PMW's font and can be
positioned as a text item, and it is also available as an exotic additional
form of notehead. You can use any of the notehead shapes without stems.

&%[Noteheads]%& controls the default settings of these features for subsequent
notes. It must be followed by one of the words `normal', `harmonic', `cross',
'circular', `none', `only', or `direct'.

.music "music65" 35 10,-18

For individual notes, option settings such as &`\nh\`& and &`\nx\`& (&R;
&<<SUBSECTnoteexpr>>&) can be used to override the default, which makes it
possible to have different noteheads within a chord.

.index "stemless notes"
.index "stems" "invisible"
.index "invisible items" "stems"
&%[Noteheads only]%& and &%[noteheads direct]%& cause subsequent notes not to
have stems. For the former, the notehead type is not altered, so &%[noteheads
cross noteheads only]%& gives stemless crosses, and &%[noteheads none noteheads
only]%& makes subsequent notes invisible. Any setting other than `only' or
`direct' enables note stems.

Because this is quite a long directive to type, and one which might appear
frequently in some music, abbreviations are provided as follows:

.itable none 0 0 3  30 left  80 left  200 left
.row &`[c]`&  "is equivalent to"  "&`[noteheads circular]`&"
.row &`[h]`&  "is equivalent to"  "&`[noteheads harmonic]`&"
.row &`[o]`&  "is equivalent to"  "&`[noteheads normal]`&"
.row &`[x]`&  "is equivalent to"  "&`[noteheads cross]`&"
.row &`[z]`&  "is equivalent to"  "&`[noteheads none]`&"
.endtable

.index "ledger lines" "with alternate noteheads"
When &%[noteheads direct]%& is selected (to show notes as &{{&#178;}}&),
ledger lines are output as normal, but there are no stems or beams. When no
noteheads are being output (&%[noteheads none]%&), breves and semibreves are
completely invisible. Stems and beams are still drawn for other notes, but
no ledger lines. See &%[notes]%& for a way of suppressing noteheads &'and'&
stems, but still drawing beams. With cross-shaped noteheads there is no
difference between the appearance of a crotchet and a minim. Breves are
distinguished from semibreves only when normal noteheads are used, and minims
and semibreves look the same with circular noteheads.


.subsection "[Notes]"
.index "&%[notes]%&"
.index "invisible items" "noteheads"
.index "invisible items" "stems"
.index "stems" "invisible"
.index "noteheads" "invisible"
.index "beams without notes"
The directive &%[notes off]%& suppresses the output of notes and their stems
(and ledger lines). However, if the notes would have been beamed, the beams are
still drawn. This can be used for placing beams in non-standard places. In
addition, if ornaments or fermatas are specified, these are shown. Making the
note or chord at the end of a tie invisible is a convenient way to output
`hanging' tie marks (&R; &<<SUBSECThangingties>>&). The effect of &%[notes
off]%& is reversed by &%[notes on]%&. See &%[noteheads]%& for a way of
suppressing noteheads while leaving both stems and beams.

.index "&%midifornotesoff%&"
.index "MIDI" "for invisible notes"
Notes that are suppressed with &%[notes off]%& are by default omitted from MIDI
output. This can be changed by including the header directive
&%midifornotesoff%&.


.subsection "[Notespacing]" SUBSECTstavens
.index "&%[notespacing]%&"
.index "&%[ns]%&"
.index "notes" "spacing"
.index "spacing" "notes"
The &%[notespacing]%& directive (abbreviation &%[ns]%&) specifies a temporary
change in the horizontal distances between notes. Internally, note spacings are
held to an accuracy of 0.001 of a point. If the directive is given with no
arguments, it resets to the values that were current at the start of the
movement. The most commonly used form of &%[notespacing]%& is the one that
changes each element in the note spacing table by a multiplicative factor. This
is done by following the keyword by an asterisk and a number (possibly
containing a decimal point) or a rational number, as in the following examples:

.itable none 0 0 2  80 left  300 left
.row "&`[ns *0.75]`&"   "change to three-quarter spacing"
.row "&`[ns *3/4]`&"    "change to three-quarter spacing"
.row "&`[ns *2]`&"      "double the spacing"
.row "&`[ns *1.5]`&"    "multiply the spacing by one and a half"
.row "&`[ns *3/2]`&"    "multiply the spacing by one and a half"
.endtable

Alternatively, the directive name can be followed (in the brackets) by up to
eight numbers, which give the &'change'& in the note spacing, in points, for
notes of different lengths, starting with the value for breves. (See the
&%notespacing%& header directive.) Trailing zero values can be omitted.
.code
[notespacing 0 0 3 -2]
.endd
This example specifies that minims are to appear three points further apart and
crotchets are to be two points closer together. The &%[notespacing]%& directive
takes effect for the remainder of the current bar on the stave where it occurs,
and for all the notes in the same bar on staves of higher number (that is,
those that are below it), and then for all notes in subsequent bars. Of course,
this may have the effect of moving notes in previous staves, in order to keep
the music properly aligned.

&*Warning*&: To avoid unexpected effects, &%[notespacing]%& is best used only
at the beginnings of bars, and preferably in the top part. When changing the
spacing for a single bar, it is all too easy to reset the note spacing within
the bar, for example:
.code
[notespacing *0.8] a-b- g d [ns] |
.endd
This may behave strangely because PMW processes bars stave by stave. It will
therefore obey the resetting directive before considering the other staves, and
only one bar on one stave will have been processed with the altered spacing.
It is usually better to use this form:
.code
[notespacing *0.8] a-b- g d | [ns]
.endd
In this case, the subsequent staves are also processed with the reduced
spacing. If a change of note spacing is always required, whatever combination
of staves is selected, it can be given on stave 0.


.subsection "[Octave]" SUBSECToctave
.index "transposition" "octave"
.index "&%[octave]%&"
When a part is in the treble clef it may be easier to enter if the letters
C&--B represent the octave starting at middle C rather than the one below it
(which is the default). The &%[octave]%& directive, which must be followed by a
number, requests transposition by the number of octaves given. The octave can
also be specified at the same time as the clef (&R; &<<SECTclef>>&).

Each octave setting replaces the previous one; they are not cumulative. The
argument for &%[octave]%& may be positive or negative:
.display
&`[octave -1]    `& C is the note two octaves below middle C
&`[octave 0]     `& C is the note one octave below middle C
&`[octave 1]     `& C is middle C
.endd
Octave transposition is in addition to any general transposition that is in
force.


.subsection "[Olevel] and [olhere]"
.index "&%[olevel]%&"
.index "&%[olhere]%&"
These directives control the position of the overlay level in exactly the same
way as &%[ulevel]%& and &%[ulhere]%& for the underlay level (&R;
&<<SUBSECTulevelhere>>&).


.subsection "[Oltextsize]"
.index "&%[oltextsize]%&"
This directive must be followed by a number in the range 1 to 20. It selects
the default size to be used for overlay text on the current stave. The actual
font sizes that correspond to the twenty numbers are set by the &%textsizes%&
header directive. If this directive is not used, the size set by the
&%overlaysize%& header directive (whose parameter is different from any of the
sizes set by &%textsizes%&) is used. &%[Oltextsize]%& is normally needed only
if you want different sizes of overlay text on different staves.


.subsection "[Overdraw]"
.index "&%[overdraw]%&"
.index "drawing facility" "drawing over everything else"
When a drawing is associated with a note or bar line by means of the &%[draw]%&
directive, the drawing output happens before the note or bar line is output.
The order does not matter when everything is black, but if the &%setgray%&
or &%setcolor%& drawing operator is being used, the drawing may need to be done
last to achieve the correct effect. &%[Overdraw]%& acts just like &%[draw]%&
except that it saves up the drawn items, and outputs them only after everything
else in the system has been output. Using &%setgray%& or &%setcolor%& with
&%[overdraw]%& makes it possible to `white out' parts of staves.


.subsection "[Overlayfont]"
.index "&%[overlayfont]%&"
.index "fonts" "default for overlay"
The default typeface for overlay text can be set for an individual stave by
means of the &%[overlayfont]%& directive, which takes as its argument one of
the standard font names.
.code
[overlayfont italic]
.endd
The default typeface for overlay text is roman. In any given text string it is
always possible to change typeface by using the appropriate escape sequence.


.subsection "[Page]"
.index "&%[page]%&"
.index "page" "skipping a number"
Occasionally there is a requirement to skip a page in the middle of a piece &--
to insert commentary in a critical edition, for example. The &%[page]%&
directive can be used to set the page number for the page on which it appears,
but it is not possible to decrease the page number. You can specify an absolute
page number, or an increment of the page number preceded by a plus sign.
.code
[page 45]
[page +1]
.endd


.subsection "[Printpitch]" SUBSECTprintpitch
.index "&%[printpitch]%&"
.index "MIDI" "untuned percussion"
The &%[midipitch]%& directive can be quite cumbersome to use if a percussion
part changes instruments frequently, even though the amount of typing can be
reduced by using macros. An alternative facility that forces the visible pitch
instead of the playing pitch is available. The &%[printpitch]%& directive takes
a note letter and optional octave indication as its argument. It causes all
subsequent notes on the stave to be output on the corresponding line or space,
whatever pitch is specified for the note in the input. The input pitch can then
be used to select different percussion instruments for MIDI output. To do this,
you need to know that middle C corresponds to MIDI note 60, C-sharp is 61, B is
59, and so on.

Of course, some indication is also required to tell a human player what to do
&-- this can take the form of graphic signs above the notes, or different
noteheads or stem directions can be used. Here is an invented example, where
the first three beats of the bar are played on a snare drum (General MIDI pitch
38), and the last beat on the cowbell (General MIDI pitch 56), indicated by a
downward pointing stem.
.code
[stave 8/1 hclef 0]
[printpitch b' stems up] d`d`d` $a-\sd\$a-  |
.endd

.music "music44" 26 4,-20

After the stave number, &`/1`& defines a one-line stave. The effect of
&%[printpitch]%& can be cancelled by supplying an asterisk as its argument.
When a percussion stave with more than one line is used to separate different
instruments, or if notes are placed above and below the line, it is probably
easiest to input each instrument's part on a separate stave, and arrange for
them to overprint each other. Then the appropriate MIDI sound can be
permanently set for each stave.


.subsection "[Reset]" SUBSECTreset
.index "&%[reset]%&"
.index "overprinting" "single bars"
Sometimes it is convenient to notate a bar as two different sequences of notes,
to be overprinted on the stave. &%[Reset]%& has the effect of resetting the
horizontal position to the start of the current bar. Anything that follows it
is overprinted on top of whatever has already been specified. If a large number
of bars require overprinting, it may be more convenient to set up an entire
overprinting stave by specifying a stave spacing of zero. If only a single note
is overprinted, the &%[backup]%& directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTbackup>>&) may be
more convenient.

&%[Reset]%& should be used with caution, because it can cause unexpected
effects if items such as slurs are in use. The distribution of pending underlay
or overlay syllables is suspended after &%[reset]%& until the position in the
bar has `caught up' to the reset point.
.code
[stems up] gabc' [reset] [stems down] efga |
.endd
This example outputs a bar containing the chords &`(eg)`&, &`(fa)`&, &`(gb)`&
and &`(ac')`&, but with the stems of each component of the chord drawn in
opposite directions. More than one &%[reset]%& may appear if necessary, and
only one set of notes need be of the correct length to satisfy the time
signature. Invisible rests, notated by the letter Q, can be useful in
conjunction with &%[reset]%&.

Because PMW processes bars from left to right, &%[reset]%& must not appear
between two notes that are connected in some way, for example, between two tied
or slurred notes. It must also not appear between any non-note item and the
note or bar line that follows, because such items are always `attached' to the
following note or bar line. Specifically, &%[reset]%& must not follow any of
the following: a clef, a tied note, the first note of a glissando, the start of
a hairpin, a mid-bar dotted line, a repeat sign, a caesura, a text item,
&%[slur]%&, &%[xslur]%&, &%[line]%&, &%[xline]%&, &%[key]%&, &%[time]%&,
&%[comma]%&, &%[tick]%&, &%[move]%&, &%[smove]%&, &%[space]%&, or a rehearsal
mark. Also, &%[reset]%& may not occur in the middle of an irregular note group.


.subsection "[Resume]"
.index "&%[resume]%&"
This directive forces a resumption of a suspended stave &-- see &%[suspend]%&
for details.


.subsection "[Rlevel]"
.index "&%[rlevel]%&"
.index "rests" "level"
.index "level" "of rests"
Rests are normally positioned centrally on the stave, as is conventional for
single parts. When two staves are being overprinted to combine two different
parts, it may be necessary to move rests up or down. A note option (&R;
&<<SUBSECTnoteexpr>>&) or &%[move]%& can be used to do this for individual
rests. The &%[rlevel]%& directive specifies an adjustment that applies to all
subsequent rests. Any adjustment specified for individual rests is added to the
current rest level as set by this directive. The argument for &%[rlevel]%& may
be positive or negative; it specifies a number of points by which the rest is
moved vertically. A positive number moves upwards, and a negative one moves
downwards.
.code
[rlevel -12]
.endd
This example causes rests to be 12 points lower than normal, so that a whole
bar rest, which normally appears below the fourth line, is now below the
bottom line of the stave.
.index "ledger lines" "for rests off the stave"
Semibreve and minim rests that are moved off the stave are shown with a single
ledger line to indicate which they are. Each occurrence of &%[rlevel]%& sets a
new level relative to the default position. They are not cumulative.


.subsection "[Rmove]"
.index "&%[rmove]%&"
This directive operates exactly as &%[move]%&, except that the horizontal
dimension is scaled to the relative stave size.


.subsection "[Rsmove]"
.index "&%[rsmove]%&"
This directive operates exactly as &%[smove]%&, except the horizontal dimension
is scaled to the relative stave size.


.subsection "[Rspace]"
.index "&%[rspace]%&"
This directive operates exactly as &%[space]%&, except that the horizontal
dimension is scaled to the relative stave size.


.subsection "[Sghere], [sgabove], and [sgnext]" SUBSECTsg
.index "&%[sghere]%&"
.index "&%[sgnext]%&"
.index "&%[sgabove]%&"
.index "system gap"
.index "spacing" "systems"
.index "gaps" "between systems"
These directives affect the system gap value, that is, the amount of vertical
space that is left between systems. Note that when just one stave is being
output (typically for a single part), it is the system gap that determines the
spacing. When vertical justification is enabled (&R; &<<SUBSECTjustify>>&), the
system gap is a minimum amount of space.

&%[Sghere]%& changes the spacing below the current system (that is, the one in
which the current bar is to appear), &%[sgabove]%& changes the spacing above
the current system, and &%[sgnext]%& makes the change for all systems that
follow the current one, but not for the current system itself. These directives
can be placed on any of the staves that comprise the system. For all of them, a
single number is required as an argument. It can be preceded by a plus or a
minus sign to indicate a relative change from the existing value.

If there is more than one occurence of these directives in a system, any that
are in stave 0 are processed first, in bar number order, followed by those in
the following staves. The last absolute setting (if any) is used, with any
relative changes acting cumulatively. Thus, for example, an absolute setting in
stave 2, bar 1 will override a relative setting in stave 1, bar 4.

The system gap is used only between systems, not at the top or bottom of a
page. If &%[sghere]%& is present in the last system on a page, or &%[sgabove]%&
in the first system on a page, they have no effect.


.subsection "[Skip]"
.index "&%[skip]%&"
.index "overprinting" "sparse staves"
.index "skipping bars"
.index "bars" "skipping"
When setting vocal or keyboard music it is common to use two overprinting
staves for notes with stems in different directions. Sometimes there are long
sequences of bars for which the second stave is not required. Such a sequence
can be notated using invisible whole bar rests, but if this is done it is still
necessary to keep the clef and key signature in step with the other stave so
that they are correct at the beginnings of lines, and at least the final time
signature change must appear in the correct place so that it is available for
checking when notes resume.

.index "&%skip%&"
An alternative approach is to use the &%[skip]%& stave directive, which should
appear at the beginning of a bar, and which causes PMW to leave a given number
of bars totally empty before proceeding with the current bar. If there is more
than one &%[skip]%& their effect it cumulative. A warning is given if
&%[skip]%& is not at the start of a bar because wherever it appears, its effect
is the same (that is, empty bars are inserted before the current bar).
.code
[stave 2 bass 0] gg | [skip 50] aa | [endstave]
.endd
This example defines a stave in which only bars 1 and 52 are defined. The
intermediate bars are treated as being completely empty. If &%[skip]%& is
required at the very start of a stave, do not include a clef setting, unless
you want a clef as part of the resumed bar after the skip. You can use the
&%[assume]%& directive to set a clef without outputting anything. See also the
the &%omitempty%& option for &%[stave]%&.


.subsection "[Slur]" SUBSECTslurs
.index "&%[slur]%&"
.index "&%[endslur]%&"
.index "&%[es]%&"
.index-from I09 "slurs" "full specification"
Slurs between adjacent single notes can be input by inserting an underline
character after the first note (&R; &<<SUBSECTshortslur>>&). When a slur covers
chords, or spans several single notes, it must be coded using the &%[slur]%&
and &%[endslur]%& directives; &%[es]%& is an abbreviation for &%[endslur]%&.
The options for the &%[slur]%& directive are also applicable to the &%[line]%&
directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTline>>&).

.subsection "Normal slurs"
The &%[slur]%& and &%[endslur]%& directives enclose the notes and/or chords
that are to be slurred.
.code
a [slur] b-a-g-f- [endslur] g
.endd
This example causes a slur to be drawn over the four beamed quavers. Slurs are
drawn above the notes by default. The shape of slurs is correct in many common
cases, but when there is a large variation in pitch in the notes being slurred,
the slur mark may sometimes need manual adjustment. Various options are
provided for the &%[slur]%& directive for this purpose. The options are
separated from each other, and from the directive name, by slashes. The
following are available:

.itable none 0 0 2  76 left  300 left
.row &`/a`&          "slur above the notes (default)"
.row &`/a`&<&'n'&>   "slur above, at fixed position above stave"
.row &`/ao`&         "slur above, at overlay level"
.row &`/b`&          "slur below the notes"
.row &`/b`&<&'n'&>   "slur below, at fixed position below stave"
.row &`/bu`&         "slur below, at underlay level"
.row &`/h`&          "force horizontal slur"
.row &`/ll`&<&'n'&>  "move the left end left by <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/lr`&<&'n'&>  "move the left end right by <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/rl`&<&'n'&>  "move the right end left by <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/rr`&<&'n'&>  "move the right end right by <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/u`&<&'n'&>   "raise the entire slur by <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/d`&<&'n'&>   "lower the entire slur by <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/lu`&<&'n'&>  "raise the left end by <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/ld`&<&'n'&>  "lower the left end by <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/ru`&<&'n'&>  "raise the right end by <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/rd`&<&'n'&>  "lower the right end by <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/ci`&<&'n'&>  "move the centre in by <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/co`&<&'n'&>  "move the centre out by <&'n'&> points"
.endtable

.index "MusicXML" "offset positioning (slur)"
Another way of specifying horizontal position for slur ends is to use &`/llc`&,
&`/lrc`&, &`/rlc`& or &`/rrc`& followed by a number that may have a fractional
part. These options specify a base horizontal position for a slur end as a
musical offset, in units of crotchets. At the start of a slur this offset is
relative to the next note. By default, at the end of a slur it is relative to
the previous note (that is, the last enclosed note). However, if the &`/cx`&
option is present, an ending offset is taken relative to the following note.
These features were added to PMW in order to simplify processing MusicXML
input. Here are some examples of the &%[slur]%& directive:
.code
[slur]
[slur/b]
[slur/u4]
[slur/lu2/co4]
[slur/rr6]
[slur/a/u4/ld2]
[slur/a/lu2/ru4]
.endd
Repeated movement qualifiers are cumulative. The options &`/u`& and &`/d`& are
shorthand for specifying an identical vertical adjustment of both ends of the
slur. Specifying &`/ci`& causes the slur to become flatter, and specifying
&`/co`& causes it to become more curved. The &`/h`& qualifier requests a
horizontal slur, that is, one in which both ends are at the same horizontal
level before any explicit adjustments are applied. This is implemented by
forcing the right-hand end to be at the same level as the left-hand end.

Use of the &`/a`& or &`/b`& options with a fixed position (for example,
&`/a8`&) initializes the vertical positions of both end points, as does the use
of the &`/ao`& or &`/bu`& options. This results in a horizontal slur by
default. The &`/h`& option is not relevant in these cases, and is ignored if
given. However, the options for moving the ends can be applied.

The &`/ao`& and &`/bu`& options are probably more useful with &%[line]%& than
with &%[slur]%&, for cases when several lines at the same level are required on
a single system. For example, if lines are being drawn for piano pedal marks
(see &%[linegap]%& for an example), using the &`/bu`& option causes them all to
be at the same level below a given stave, and to be positioned just below the
lowest note on that stave. If there is overlay or underlay text for a stave,
the overlay or underlay level is computed by taking into account only those
notes that actually have associated text or dashes or extender lines. If not,
all the notes on the stave are taken into account.

One particular use of the options for moving the ends of slurs horizontally is
for notating a slur (or tie) that extends from the last note of a bar up to the
bar line and no further, or from the bar line to the first note in a bar. These
are needed for some kinds of first and second time bar. A slur that includes
only one note provokes an error, because it is an attempt to draw a slur of
zero horizontal extent.
.code
[slur] a [endslur]
.endd
This example is incorrect. However, if one end of the slur is moved, all is
well.
.code
[slur/rr15] a [endslur]
.endd
This example is acceptable. The slur starts at the note, and extends for 15
points to the right. Slurs may be nested to any depth.
.code
a b [slur] c d | [slur/b] e f g [es] a | f e [es] d c |
.endd
This  has a long slur extending from the middle of the first bar to the middle
of the third bar, with a shorter slur below three notes in the second bar. In
other words, the first &%[slur]%& matches with the last &%[es]%&. A similar
example, together with its output, is shown in section &<<SECTtiesslurs>>&.


.subsection "Additional control of slur shapes"
.index "slurs" "control of shape"
.index "B&eacute;zier curves"
Slurs are drawn using B&eacute;zier curves, which are described in many books
on computer graphics. A B&eacute;zier curve is defined by two end points and
two control points. The curve starts out from its starting point towards the
first control point, and ends up at the finishing point coming from the
direction of the second control point. The greater the distance of the control
points from the end points, the more the curve goes towards the control points
before turning back to the end point. It does not, however, pass through the
control points.

For slurs, the control points are normally positioned symmetrically, giving
rise to a symmetric curve. The &`/co`& and &`/ci`& (`curve out' and `curve in')
options described above are used to move the control points further from or
nearer to the line between the endpoints, respectively. Occasionally,
non-symmetric slurs are needed, and so some additional options are provided to
enable the positions of the two control points to be independently moved.

.itable none 0 0 2  76 left  300 left
.row &`/clu`&<&'n'&>  "move left control point up <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/cld`&<&'n'&>  "move left control point down <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/cll`&<&'n'&>  "move left control point left <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/clr`&<&'n'&>  "move left control point right <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/cru`&<&'n'&>  "move right control point up <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/crd`&<&'n'&>  "move right control point down <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/crl`&<&'n'&>  "move right control point left <&'n'&> points"
.row &`/crr`&<&'n'&>  "move right control point right <&'n'&> points"
.endtable

Thus, for example, &%[slur/a/clu40]%& draws a slur that bulges upwards on the
left. Experimentation is usually needed to find out the precise values needed
for a given shape. The directions of movement for these options are not the
normal ones, except when a slur is horizontal. When a slur's end points are not
at the same level, the coordinate system is rotated so that the new
`horizontal' is the line joining the end points. In most cases this rotation is
small, and so the difference is not great. In all cases, the left control point
relates to the left-hand end of the slur, and the right control point relates
to the right-hand end, whichever way up the slur is drawn.


.subsection "Editorial and dashed slurs"
.index "slurs" "dashed"
.index "slurs" "editorial"
.index "dashed slurs"
.index "editorial slurs"
Three alternative forms of slur are provided: dashed slurs, dotted slurs, and
`editorial' slurs. The latter have a short vertical stroke through their
midpoint if they are symmetric in shape, or near the midpoint otherwise. The
alternatives are specified by qualifiers on the directive.
.display
&`/i `&    draw an `intermittent' (dashed) slur
&`/ip`&    draw an `intermittent points' (dotted) slur
&`/e `&    draw an editorial slur
.endd
These qualifiers can be freely mixed with the other slur qualifiers. However,
if a slur is dashed or dotted, and also marked `editorial', no attempt is made
to ensure that the editorial mark coincides with a solid bit of slur.


.subsection "Wiggly slurs"
.index "slurs" "wiggly"
.index "wiggly slurs"
The option &`/w`& causes the curvature of the slur to change sides in the
middle. For example, a wiggly slur below some notes starts curving downwards,
but then changes to curving upwards. The slur may be solid, dashed, dotted, or
editorial. If a wiggly slur crosses the end of a system, the portion on the
first system curves one way, and the portion on the next system curves the
other way.


.subsection "Split slurs"
.index "split slurs"
.index "slurs" "split"
Slurs are correctly continued if they span a boundary between two systems. By
default, such slurs are not continued over warning key or time signatures at
the ends of lines, but PMW can be requested to do this by means of the
&%sluroverwarnings%& header directive. The shape and positioning of the end of
the first part of a split slur are controlled by the &%endlineslurstyle%& and
&%endlinesluradjust%& directives.

The sections of a slur that extends over one or more line ends are numbered
from 1. An option in a &%[slur]%& directive that consists just of a number
means that subsequent options apply only to the given section. Thus, for
example, &%[slur/3/lu4/co4]%& moves the left-hand end of the third section
upwards, and increases its curvature. Spaces are allowed between options, and
these can be used to make a complicated slur more readable by separating the
various sections.
.code
[slur /1/co2 /2/lu4/rd6]
.endd
The only options that may appear after a section selector are those that move
endpoints or control curvature, that is, &`/u`&, &`/d`& and those options
beginning with &`/l`&, &`/r`&, and &`/c`&. If a section number is given that is
greater than the number of sections, its data is ignored, and when a slur is
not split, all section-specific options are ignored, even those for section 1.
Movement and curvature options that appear before the first section selector
are handled as follows:
.ilist
All options beginning with &`/c`& apply only when the slur is not split.
.next
The &`/u`& and &`/d`& options apply to all endpoints of all sections, whether
or not the slur is split.
.next
Options beginning with &`/l`& (the letter) apply to the starting point of the
slur, whether or not it is split. To move the starting point only when the slur
is split (but not if it is not) these options can be given after &`/1`& (the
digit), in which case they are added to any values given before the selector.
.next
Any vertical movement specified with &`/lu`& or &`/ld`& is also applied to the
right-hand end of the first section of a split slur. To affect only the
left-hand end, put these options after &`/1`& (the digit).
.next
Options beginning with &`/r`& apply to the final endpoint of the slur, whether
or not it is split. To move the endpoint only when the slur is split (but not
if it is not) these options can be given after &`/`&<&'n'&>, where <&'n'&> is
the number of the final section, in which case they are added to any values
given before the selector.
.next
Any vertical movement specified with &`/ru`& or &`/rd`& is also applied to the
left-hand end of the final section of the slur. To affect only the right-hand
end, put these options after &`/`&<&'n'&>.
.endlist
If &`/ao`& or &`/bu`& is specified for a slur that is split, each section of
the slur is positioned at the overlay or underlay level for its own stave, but
can of course be moved by suitable options after a section selector. Similarly,
&`/a`& and &`/b`&, if given with a dimension, cause all sections of a split
slur to be positioned at the given vertical position. If a wiggly slur is
split, the first section curves one way, and all subsequent ones curve the
other way.



.subsection "Overlapping nested slurs" SUBSECTxslur
.index "slurs" "overlapping"
.index "overlapping slurs"
.index "&%[xslur]%&"
Usually slurs are properly nested, that is, if a second slur starts within a
slur, the inner slur ends before the outer slur. The slur notation in PMW is
naturally nested, and automatically ensures that this convention is followed.
Any number of slurs may be started at any one time on a stave. The data for a
given slur (starting coordinates, etc.) are placed on a stack when the
&%[slur]%& directive is obeyed. If another slur is started before the first one
is complete, its data goes on top of the stack, temporarily `hiding' any
previous data that may be already there. When &%[endslur]%& is obeyed, it
terminates the slur whose data is on the top of the stack (and that data is
removed). By default, therefore, &%[endslur]%& always terminates the most
recently started slur.

Very occasionally, it is useful to be able to start a second slur
within a slur and have it cross over the outer slur. More commonly, it is
sometimes necessary to have one slur ending and the next beginning on the same
note &-- something that is not possible using the normal PMW slur notation,
because slur starts are notated before notes and slur ends afterwards.
.index "crossing slurs"
.index "slurs" "crossing"
To make this possible, the &%[xslur]%& (`crossing slur') directive causes an
innermost nested slur cross over the one immediately outside it.
.code
[slur] a [xslur] b [es] c [es]
.endd
This example draws one slur covering the first two notes, and the next slur
covering the second and third notes. The &%[xslur]%& directive does not place
its data on the top of the stack (unless the stack is empty). Instead, it
places it one position down in the stack. Thus, the next &%[endslur]%&
terminates the previously started slur, leaving the latest one still
incomplete, and in the example above, the first &%[es]%& is thereby made to
refer to the &%[slur]%& directive and the second to the &%[xslur]%& instead of
the other way round. This facility is available for the innermost nested slur
only.


.subsection "Tagged slurs" SUBSECTtaggedslurs
.index "tagged slurs"
.index "slurs" "tagged"
In very complicated music, even the &%[xslur]%& facility is not powerful enough
to describe what is wanted, and it is necessary to use `tagged' slurs. The
qualifier &`/=`& can be used within a &%[slur]%& directive to `tag' a slur. It
must be followed by a single ASCII alphanumeric character, which acts as an
identifier. It is recommended that capital letters normally be used, as they
are visually distinctive. Tagging is also available for lines drawn with
&%[line]%&. These are just treated as differently drawn slurs, and they share
the same tagging name space. A tagged slur is placed on top of the stack as
normal. The &%[endslur]%& directive may also contain a tag, using the same
syntax. When a tagged &%[endslur]%& directive is obeyed, the stack of
unterminated slurs is searched for a slur with a matching tag, and if one is
found, that slur is terminated. If no matching slur is found, an error message
is given and the slur on the top of the stack is terminated. When &%[endslur]%&
does not contain a tag, the topmost slur is terminated, whether or not it is
tagged. Here is an example of the use of tagged slurs:
.code
[slur/=A] [slur/b/=Z] ggg [slur/=B] a [es/=A] a [es/=Z] a [es] |
.endd

.music "music43" 32 4,-20

.index-to I09


.subsection "[Slurgap]" SUBSECTslurgap
.index "&%[slurgap]%&"
.index "slurs" "gaps in"
.index "gaps" "in slurs"
The &%[slurgap]%& directive has the same options as &%[linegap]%&, and can be
used to leave gaps in slurs where they would otherwise cross over other items.
For example, to avoid drawing a slur through a key signature:
.code
r [slur/co3/lu2] G`+ [slurgap/w30/r10] | [key e$] c G' [es] |
.endd

.music "music52" 34 4,-14

Specifying a gap associated with a text string or a drawing function provides a
way of adding arbitrary annotation to a slur &-- a width of zero can be given
if no actual gap in the slur is required. When an associated drawing function
is obeyed, the origin is halfway along the straight line joining the edges of
the gap, and the &%linegapx%& and &%linegapy%& variables are set as for
&%[linegap]%&. Bracketed slurs can be done using a drawing function, but the
text option is probably easier.
.code
[slur slurgap/h0/w0/"(  " slurgap/h1/w0/"  )"]
.endd
In this example, the &`/h0`& and &`/h1`& options specify the start and end of
the slur, respectively, and &`/w0`& specifies a gap of zero width. String
options can be used to alter the size or position of the text as required. A
gap specified for a dashed slur is liable to result in partial dashes being
drawn, unless its length is carefully adjusted.


.subsection "[Smove]"
.index "&%[smove]%&"
This directive is a shorthand for combining a &%[move]%& and a &%[space]%&
directive. The following two lines of input are equivalent:
.code
[move  6] a [space 6]
[smove 6] a
.endd
This is common usage when adjusting the position of notes on overprinting
staves. &%[Smove]%& can take two arguments, like &%[move%&], with the second
one specifying vertical movement for the move. The horizontal value is not
scaled by the stave size &-- use &%[rsmove]%& if you want this to be scaled.


.subsection "[Soprabass]"
.index "&%[soprabass]%&"
This specifies a bass clef with a little `8' above it (&R;
&<<SECTclef>>&).


.subsection "[Soprano]"
.index "&%[soprano]%&"
This specifies a C clef with its centre on the bottom stave line (&R;
&<<SECTclef>>&).


.subsection "[Space]"
.index "&%[space]%&"
.index "space" "inserting in staves"
The &%[space]%& directive, which has a single number as an argument, causes
space to be inserted before the next note or rest in the bar, or before the bar
line if there are no more notes or rests. The remainder of the bar, including
appropriate items on other staves, is adjusted accordingly. The number can be
positive or negative; a negative value removes space from the bar. The space is
not scaled by the relative stave size. If you want to insert scaled space, use
&%[rspace]%&.

&*Note*&: unlike &%[move]%&, &%[space]%& always affects the position of the
next note, rest, or bar line, even if some other item intervenes. Other items
are positioned relative to the note, rest, or bar line that follows them.
Therefore, adjusting the position of a note, rest, or bar line with &%[space]%&
affects these items too. The following two examples have exactly the same
effect:
.code
[comma] [space 6] A
[space 6] [comma] A
.endd
The &%[move]%& directive can be used in conjunction with &%[space]%& to insert
space between a non-note item and the note to which it is related.
.code
[space 6][move -6][comma] A
.endd
In this example, &%[space]%& moves both the note and its attached comma (and
everything that follows) to the right; &%[move]%& then moves the comma back to
where it would have been without the inserted space. &%[Space]%& is obeyed when
PMW is figuring out where to position the notes in the bar, whereas &%[move]%&
is obeyed when the bar is output.

The handling of multiple occurences of &%[space]%& at the same point in the bar
depends on their positioning. Multiple occurrences on the same stave are
cumulative, so the following are equivalent:
.code
[space 2] [tick] [space 2] A
[space 4] [tick] A
[tick] [space 6 space -2] A
.endd
After any accumulation, PMW checks the extra space value for this position, as
set by any lower-numbered stave(s), with default zero. If the new value is
non-negative, it is retained if it is greater than the current setting;
otherwise it is retained if it is less. This normally gives the right effect if
extra space is accidentally specified in two different staves. See also
&%[ensure]%&, &%[move]%&, &%[smove]%&, &%[rspace]%&, &%[rmove]%&, and
&%[rsmove]%&.



.subsection "[Ssabove], [sshere], and [ssnext]" SUBSECTss
.index "&%[ssabove]%&"
.index "&%[sshere]%&"
.index "&%[ssnext]%&"
.index "staves" "spacing"
.index "spacing" "staves"
These directives affect vertical stave spacing in the current movement only.
See section &<<SUBSECTstavespacing>>& for how to set initial values for the
movement that also apply by default to subsequent movements.

&%[Ssabove]%& differs from the other two in that it sets a minimum spacing
&'above'& staves; the other two adjust the actual settings for spacing below
staves. For example, if the spacing for stave 2 has been set to 50, an
occurrence of &%[ssabove 40]%& in stave 3 would have no effect, but &%[ssabove
60]%& would increase the distance between staves 2 and 3.

The difference between the other two directives is that &%[sshere]%& changes
the spacing for the current system only (that is, the one in which the current
bar appears), whereas &%[ssnext]%& makes the change for all systems that follow
the current one.

If any of these directives is followed by a single number, the setting applies
to the current stave only, except when the current stave is number zero, in
which case the value applies to all staves. For example, a bar with very low
notes might require notating thus:
.code
[treble 1] [sshere 60] f` a` c e |
.endd
This example has the effect of setting the stave spacing to 60 points, for the
current stave in the current system only. If the number is preceded by a plus
or minus sign, it is interpreted as a change to the existing spacing.
.code
[sshere +10]
.endd
This example adds 10 points to the stave spacing for the current stave in the
current system. The argument for these directives can also take the form of two
numbers separated by a slash, in which case the first is a stave number and the
second is a spacing (which may be preceded by a plus or minus sign). More than
one pair may be present. This makes it possible to encode all stave spacing
changes in the same stave.
.code
[ssnext 2/+8 3/-10 4/44]
.endd
If zero is given as a stave number, the spacing setting is applied to all the
staves. If there is more than one occurence of any of these directives in a
system, those in stave 1 are processed first, in bar number order, followed by
those in the following staves. For any given stave, the last absolute setting
(if any) is used, with any relative changes acting cumulatively. Thus, for
example, an absolute setting in stave 2, bar 1 will override a relative setting
in stave 1, bar 4.

When &%[ssnext]%& is used with a plus or minus sign, without a preceding
absolute setting, the value is relative to the original spacing for the
stave, ignoring any changes that might have been made with &%[sshere]%&.



.subsection "[Stave]" SUBSECTstave
.index "&%[stave]%&"
The first thing in each stave's data must be the &%[stave]%& directive. In its
most basic form, the name is followed by just a stave number. This may be
followed by a slash and a number in the range 0&--6, specifying the number of
stave lines (default 5).
.index "staves" "number of lines"
.index "alternatives to 5-line staves"
.index "invisible items" "stave"
.index "staves" "invisible"
A stave with no lines is an invisible stave. Two-line and three-line staves
have double the normal stave line spacing, and are centred about the middle
line of the normal five-line position. They are designed for multiple
percussion parts. A three-line stave at the normal spacing can be obtained by
overprinting a one-line and a two-line stave.
.index "guitar tablature"
Four-line and six-line staves are five-line staves with the top line missing
or an additional line added above the top, respectively. When used for guitar
tablature they should normally be enlarged by means of the &%stavesize%&
header directive. The &%contrib%& directory in the PMW distribution contains
an example of guitar tablature.

The number of stave lines has no implications for key signatures or clefs.
.index "ledger lines" "with non-standard staves"
For staves with fewer than five lines, ledger lines are not shown for notes
that are off the stave. On one-line staves, whole bar rests are output under
the single line, and on three-line staves they are under the top line. In all
other respects the behaviour of PMW is unchanged by the number of stave lines.

Following the stave number and optional number of lines, the word &%omitempty%&
may appear. This causes nothing whatsoever to be output for completely empty
bars. See section &<<SUBSECTomitempty>>& below for details. Further arguments
may be given to specify text or drawings to be output at the lefthand side of
the stave. Most commonly, &%[stave]%& is used just with text, and this form is
described first.

.subsection "Text at stave starts" SUBSECTstavetext
.index "text" "at stave start"
The text-only form of &%[stave]%& has the following format, where the stave
number &'n'& can be followed the number of stave lines and/or &`omitempty`&, as
just described:
.display
&`[stave `&<&'n'&>&` "`&<&'string1'&>&`" "`&<&'string2'&>&`" ...]`&
.endd
.index "part names"
.index "staves" "names for"
There may be any number of string arguments. By default, the first one is used
in the first system of the movement, and the second one for subsequent systems
(see the next section for multiple strings for the same system). These strings
are normally used for the name of the instrument or voice for which the stave
is intended.
.code
[stave 1 "Soprano" "S"]
.endd
This example has `Soprano' at the start of the first system, and `S' on all the
others. If there is only one string, only the first system has text at the
start. The third and subsequent strings in &%[stave]%& directives are not used
automatically, but can be selected at any point in the
.index "&%[name]%&"
piece by means of the &%[name]%& stave directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTname>>&), which
also provides an alternative way of specifying text and drawings for the
beginnings of staves.

.index "| (vertical bar) in strings"
If a vertical bar appears in one of the strings, it specifies the start of a
new line of text.
.code
[stave 5 "Trumpet|in G"]
.endd
This example outputs two lines at the start of the stave 5 in the first system.
The amount of space used for start-of-stave text depends on the longest text
line for any stave. By default, shorter lines are left-aligned in this space,
but the options &`/c`& and &`/e`& can be used to centre or right-justify the
lines. If both &`/c`& and &`/e`& are given, and the text consists of multiple
lines (delimited with &`|`& characters), the longest line is right justified,
and all the other lines for the stave have their centres aligned with the
centre of the longest. If there is only one line, it is right justified.

.index "text" "halfway between staves"
You can position text vertically halfway between two successive staves by
appending &`/m`& (for `middle') to the text on the upper of the two staves.
.code
[stave 1 "Piano"/m]
.endd
If two overprinting staves are being used for a keyboard part, the text may
appear with either of them, because if the space after the current stave is set
to zero, the space for the next stave is used when positioning such text,
unless such a stave is suspended, in which case &`/m`& is ignored. It is also
ignored if the following stave is suspended. As an example of where this is
relevant, consider this input:
.code
[stave 1 "Horns"/m "Hn"/m]
...
[endstave]
[stave 2]
...
[endstave]
.endd
When both horn parts are being output, the text is shown halfway between them,
but if the second stave is suspended, the text aligns with the first stave.

You can specify a size for text at the start of a stave by following the string
with &`/s`& or &`/S`& and a number. For &`/s`&, the number selects a text size
from the list given to the &%textsizes%& directive, whereas &`/S`& selects one
of the fixed sizes (&R; &<<SUBSECTtextsizeoption>>&).
.code
[stave 1 "Flute"/s2]
.endd
The size is not affected by any relative magnification that may be applied to
the stave. If no size is specified, a 10-point font is used.

.index "text" "rotated stave names"
.index "staves" "rotated names"
You can also specify that the text be rotated through 90&deg; so that it runs
vertically up the page and its midpoint is approximately at the middle of the
stave. This is specified with the &`/v`& option; &`/c`& and &`/e`& are ignored.
.code
[stave 3 "Chorus"/v]
.endd
Only a single line of text is supported when output is vertical, and hence the
vertical bar character has no special meaning in this case. When &`/v`& is
combined with &`/m`&, the text is both rotated and moved down so that its
midpoint is halfway between the staves.

Finally, you can use &`/u`&, &`/d`&, &`/l`&, or &`/r`& to move text up, down,
left, or right from its default position. When there is more than one line,
these qualifiers apply to all of them. For vertical text, `up' still means up
the page.

If more than one string is given for any stave, the various qualifiers can be
used on any of them, and apply only to those strings for which they appear.


.subsection "Multiple strings at stave starts"
.index "staves" "names, multiple strings"
Sometimes it is useful to be able to specify two or more strings, possibly at
different sizes or with different options, to be output together at the start
of the same stave. This is notated by ending a string with a slash followed
immediately by the next string, with no intervening space. Here is an example
where this feature is useful:

.music "music57" 74 4,-14

The start of the input for stave 1 in this example is:
.code
[stave 1 "1"/e/"Horns in F"/m/s2 treble 1]
.endd
Both strings are output at the start of the stave, with &`/m`& being used to
move the second one down to the halfway point before the second stave, and
&`/s`& being used to select a different size. If &`/m`& had not been used, the
two strings would have overprinted each other. This facility is not confined to
the first string in a &%[stave]%& directive; it can be used with any string.


.subsection "Drawings at stave starts"
.index "drawing facility" "at stave starts"
.index "staves" "drawing at start"
A drawing function (see chapter &<<CHAPdraw>>&) can be specified at the start
of a stave, instead of, or as well as, a text string. The amount of space to
the left of the stave is controlled by the text string, so a string consisting
of blanks can be used to ensure that an appropriate amount of space is left.
.index "guitar tablature"
The &%contrib%& directory in the PMW distribution contains an example where a
drawing function associated with a stave is used to generate a special kind of
`clef' for guitar tablature. The full syntax of &%[stave]%& is as follows:
.display
&`[stave `&<&'n'&>&` `&<&'string'&>&` draw `&<&'arguments'&>&` `&<&'drawing name'&>&` ...]`&
.endd
This feature is also available for the &%[name]%& directive. If both a string
and a call to a drawing function are present, the string must come first.
.code
[stave 3 "      " draw thing]
.endd
As in all drawings, the arguments (which may be numbers or strings) are
optional. The origin of the coordinate system is at the left-hand margin of the
page and at the level of the bottom line of the stave. The drawing variable
&%stavestart%& contains the x-coordinate of the start of the stave itself. Just
as there may be more than one string specified, for use on different systems,
there may also be more than one drawing function. They are listed in order,
following the corresponding strings, if present.
.code
[stave 23  "Trumpet" draw 2.5 thing2  "Tr." draw "arg" thing3]
.endd
There is an ambiguity if an item that consists only of a string (with no
associated drawing) is followed by an item consisting only of a drawing. In
this case, an empty string must be specified for the second item, to prevent
the drawing being incorrectly associated with the first item. There is also a
possibility of ambiguity if the first item on the stave itself is a call to a
drawing function, and there is no other intervening directive. The drawing must
be put into a new set of square brackets to prevent this.
.code
[stave 35 "Flute"] [draw thing3]
.endd
In this example the &%stave%& directive is terminated by the closing square
bracket, so the &%draw%& directive is taken as part of the stave data and is
associated with the following note in the usual way.


.subsection "Omitting empty bars" SUBSECTomitempty
.index "&%omitempty%& stave option"
.index "omitting empty staves"
.index "omitting empty bars"
.index "empty bars, omitting"
.index "empty staves, omitting"
.index "staves" "omitting if empty"
.index "bars" "omitting if empty"
When a stave is about to be suspended (&R; &<<SECTsuspend>>&,
&<<SUBSECTsuspend>>&), it is sometimes desirable not to output stave lines after
the final bar that contains notes, and similarly, when a stave is resumed,
empty bars preceding the resuming bar may not be required. If the
&%omitempty%& option is specified for a &%[stave]%& directive, &'nothing at
all'& is output for bars for which no data is supplied. Such bars can be
set up by means of the &%[skip]%& stave directive, or by omitting them at the
end of a stave's data. Note that a bar that is specified as a rest bar, visible
or invisible, counts as a bar for which there &'is'& data, and a clef
specification also counts as data. Therefore, if bars are to be omitted at the
start of a stave, the input should be as in this example:
.code
[stave 3 omitempty skip 20]
.endd
A clef specification (possibly made invisible by means of &%[assume]%&)
can then follow. It is not necessary for the suspend mechanism to be used with
this feature, though if is not, vertical white space is left for the stave,
even if nothing is output in that space. When a non-empty bar follows an empty
bar in a stave for which &%omitempty%& has been set, and it is not the first
bar in a system, a bar line is needed at its start. By default, a
conventional solid bar line is output, but it is possible to specify other bar
line styles, a double bar line, or an invisible bar line, by using the normal
PMW notations for these things at the end of the preceding empty bar.
.code
[stave 1 omitempty treble 1] ggg |? [skip 3] |? aaa |
.endd

.music "music51" 32 8,-16

This example specifies no bar line at the end of the bar
before the skip, nor at the start of the final bar. Without the question marks,
there would be bar lines in both these places. Note that because of the way
&%[skip]%& works, this example contains 4 empty bars, not 3. The gap in this
case is quite small, because, in the absence of other staves, PMW has packed
them up into a single (invisible) `rest' bar.

.index "isolated bars"
One or more &%omitempty%& staves can be used for positioning isolated bars on a
page, using empty bars between them to cause horizontal white spaces to appear.
The size of the white spaces can be controlled by the use of &%[space]%&
directives on stave 0 &-- they cannot be used in the empty bars, because that
causes PMW to treat them as not empty.




.subsection "[Stavelines]"
This is an obsolete directive that was used to set the number of stave lines.
Because this is a characteristic of the entire stave, this parameter is now set
as part of the &%[stave]%& directive. The old directive still works, with a
warning, but may be removed in a future release.




.subsection "[Stemlength]"
.index "&%[stemlength]%&"
.index "stems" "length"
.index "length" "of stems"
The &%[stemlength]%& directive is used to set a default value for the stem
length adjustment on a stave. It applies to all stemmed notes, both single and
beamed.
.code
[stemlength -2]
.endd
This example specifies that subsequent notes should have stems that are 2
points shorter than normal. A value of zero resets to the initial state. Any
stem length adjustments that are given on individual notes are added to the
overall default. The name &%[sl]%& is a synonym for &%[stemlength]%&. The
default stem length can be changed as often as necessary. PMW can also be
instructed to automatically shorten the stems of notes whose stems point the
`wrong' way. See the &%shortenstems%& header directive for details.


.subsection "[Stems]"
.index "&%[stems]%&"
.index "stems" "direction"
This directive controls the vertical direction of stems and can also adjust
their horizontal positioning. Normally PMW chooses for itself in which
direction to draw note stems. Details of the rules it uses are given in section
&<<SECTstemdir>>&. Some variation is possible by means of the &%stemswap%&
header directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTstemswap>>&). You can also force note stems to
point upwards or downwards, wherever the noteheads are on the stave. For
individual notes there are options to do this; the &%[stems]%& directive sets a
default for any notes that are not explicitly marked. When used for this
purpose it must be followed by one of the words `up' (or `above'), `down' (or
`below'), or `auto' &-- the last causing a reversion to the default state.

.index "stems" "central with notehead"
The &%[stems]%& directive may also be followed by `central'. This causes note
stems to be positioned horizontally aligned with the centres of noteheads
instead of at the edges. This feature is provided for some experimental music
notation; it can be turned off by the word `beside'. Currently this works only
with full-sized notes, not cue or grace notes.


.subsection "[Suspend]" SUBSECTsuspend
.index "&%[suspend]%&"
.index "suspending staves"
When a part is silent for a long time, it is often desirable in full scores to
suppress its stave from the relevant systems. The term `suspended' is used in
PMW to describe a stave that is not currently being included. The &%[suspend]%&
directive tells PMW that it may suspend the current stave from the start of the
next system, provided that there are no notes or text items on this stave in
that system. The suspension ends automatically when a system is encountered in
which there are notes or text on this stave.
.code
[suspend] [108] R! |
.endd
This example specifies 108 bars rest, which can be suspended where possible. If
the &%[suspend]%& directive appears in the first rest bar, as in this example,
at least one rest bar is output before the stave is suspended. If no rest bar
is wanted before the suspension, &%[suspend]%& should be placed in the
preceding bar.
.code
abcd [suspend] | [108] R! |
.endd
.index "&%[resume]%&"
Suspension can be ended early by the &%[resume]%& directive. If at least one
rest bar is required when the stave is resumed, an explicit &%[resume]%& must
appear in the last rest bar, because by default the stave may resume with a
non-rest bar at the beginning of a system.
.code
[suspend] [107] R! | [resume] R! |
.endd
When a single part is being output, &%[suspend]%& has no effect, because
a sequence of rest bars is automatically packed up into a single bar with a
multiple rest sign. Because &%[suspend]%& stave directive takes effect from the
start of the following system of staves, it cannot be used to cause suspension
right at the start of a piece. The &%suspend%& header directive is provided
for this purpose.


.subsection "[Tenor]"
.index "&%[tenor]%&"
This specifies a C clef with its centre on the fourth stave line (&R;
&<<SECTclef>>&).


.subsection "[Text]"
.index "&%[text]%&"
.index "text" "default type"
The default type for text within a stave (which implies a default vertical
level and size) can be set for an individual stave by means of the &%[text]%&
directive. It takes a word as its argument, which in two cases may optionally
be followed by a dimension.

.itable none 0 0 2  120 left  300 left
.row "&`[text above]`&"              "output above the stave"
.row "&`[text above`& <&'n'&>&`]`&"  "ditto, at a fixed level"
.row "&`[text below]`&"              "output below the stave"
.row "&`[text below`& <&'n'&>&`]`&"  "ditto, at a fixed level"
.row "&`[text underlay]`&"           "default is underlay"
.row "&`[text overlay]`&"            "default is overlay"
.row "&`[text fb]`&"                 "default is figured bass"
.row "&`[text fbu]`&"                "default is figured bass at underlay level"
.endtable

The words &`above`& or &`below`& may be followed by an unsigned number, which
specifies a fixed level above or below the stave, respectively. To override a
default with a fixed level (for example &`[text above 15]`&) on an individual
string, the text options &`/a`& or &`/b`& without a following number can be
used (as well as &`/ul`&, &`/fb`&, &`/fbu`&, or &`/m`&). Similarly, the
appearance of &%[text above]%& or &%[text below]%& without a number resets to
the initial state, where the default level depends on the next note.

Ordinary text that is positioned above or below the stave is by default output
at settable size 1 (specified by the &%textsizes%& header directive), unless
the &%[textsize]%& directive has specified otherwise. Underlay, overlay, and
figured bass text is output by default at the sizes specified by the
&%underlaysize%&, &%overlaysize%&, and &%fbsize%& header directives. The
default text type and size can always be overridden by explicit qualifiers
following the string. For example, if &%[text underlay]%& has been specified,
an italic dynamic mark above the stave is coded like this:
.code
"\it\ff"/a
.endd
The default text type can be changed many times within one stave.


.subsection "[Textfont]"
.index "&%[textfont]%&"
.index "fonts" "default for text"
.index "text" "default font"
The default typeface for text other than underlay, overlay, or figured bass can
be set for an individual stave by means of the &%[textfont]%& directive, which
takes as its argument one of the standard font names.
.code
[textfont extra 3]
.endd
This example supposes that the third extra font has been defined for some
special use in the stave's text. The default font for this kind of text is
italic. The defaults for underlay, overlay, and figured bass text are set by
&%[underlayfont]%&, &%[overlayfont]%&, and &%[fbfont]%&, respectively. In any
given text string it is always possible to change font by using the appropriate
escape sequence.


.subsection "[Textsize]"
.index "&%[textsize]%&"
This directive must be followed by a number in the range 1 to 20. It selects
the default size to be used for text that is neither underlay nor overlay nor
figured bass, which have their own size setting directives. The actual font
sizes that correspond to the twenty numbers are set by the &%textsizes%&
header directive. If this directive is not used, the default size is size 1.
Individual text strings can have their sizes set by means of the &`/s`& option,
or by &`/S`&, which selects from a set of fixed sizes.


.subsection "[Tick]"
.index "&%[tick]%&"
.index "pause" "tick"
.pi sdop "subscript_down=""20"""
The &%[tick]%& directive causes PMW to insert a tick &-[&{(zz&#128;)}&]-& pause
mark above the current stave. See also &%[comma]%&.
.pi sdop "subscript_down=""33"""


.subsection "[Ties]"
.index "&%[ties]%&"
.index "ties" "direction"
Normally PMW draws tie marks on the opposite side of the noteheads from the
stem. However, it is possible to force ties to be above or below the noteheads.
For individual ties there is an option qualifier to do this. In addition, the
&%[ties]%& directive is available for forcing the tie direction for all
subsequent ties that are not explicitly marked. The argument must be one of the
words `above', `up', `below', `down', or 'auto' &-- the last causing a
reversion to the default state.
.index "chords" "tied"
The effect of this directove on chords is to force &'all'& the tie marks for a
chord to the given side of the noteheads by default. However, when overriding
the default for an individual chord, you can specify that some are above and
some below the noteheads (&R; &<<SUBSECTshortslur>>&).


.subsection "[Time]"
.index "&%[time]%&"
.index "time signatures" "changing"
The time signature for a stave can be changed at the start of a bar by the
&%[time]%& directive. If the change of time falls at the start of a system, a
cautionary time signature is output at the end of the previous line unless the
word `nowarn' is included in the directive.
.code
[time 6/8 nowarn]
.endd
There is also a header directive, &%notimewarn%&, for suppressing all
cautionary time signatures.
.index "time signatures" "different on different staves"
PMW does not work sensibly by default if different time signatures are used on
different staves, unless they represent the same length of musical notes. For
example, if one stave is in 3/4 time and another is in 6/8 all will be well,
but PMW cannot cope with 2/4 against 6/8 without additional input (&R;
&<<SUBSECTstadiffsig>>&).

When a bar starts with a new time signature and a repeat mark, the order in
which these appear depends on their order in the input.
.code
[time 4/4] (:
(: [time 4/4]
.endd
The first example causes the time signature to be first, followed by the repeat
mark, whereas the second example causes the repeat mark to be amalgamated with
the previous bar line, with the time signature following. If, at the same point
in the music, these items appear in different orders on different staves, the
repeat sign is put first on all staves.

Sometimes two time signatures are needed at the start of a piece (for example,
if there are alternate bars in different times). The simplest way to do this is
to make use of the &%printtime%& header directive.


.subsection "Staves with differing time signatures" SUBSECTstadiffsig
.index "time signatures" "differing"
.index "differing time signatures"
PMW requires no special action to handle staves with different time signatures
if the actual barlengths (measured in notes) are the same. For example 3/4 and
6/8 bars both contain six quavers, and so are compatible. PMW can also handle
time signatures that are not compatible, for example, 6/8 in one stave and 2/4
in another, but because PMW handles just one stave at a time when it is reading
the music in, it is necessary to tell it what is going on by giving a second
time signature in the &%[time]%& directive, preceded by &`->`&.
.code
time 6/8
[stave 1 treble 1] a. b-a-g- | [endstave]
[stave 2 bass 0 time 2/4 -> 6/8] c-d-; e-f- | [endstave]
.endd
The first signature is the one that is output, and this corresponds to the
notes in the bar; the second signature is the one from the other stave.
The notes are stretched or compressed (in position on the stave and in time
when generating a MIDI file) to make the bar lengths match.


.subsection "[Topmargin]"
.index "&%[topmargin]%&"
.index "page" "top margin"
.index "margin" "top"
This directive provides a way of changing the value given by the &%topmargin%&
header directive for a single page only. If there is more than one occurrence
on the same page, the last value is used. To leave 30 points at the top of one
particular page, for example, use &%[topmargin 30]%& in any bar on that page.


.subsection "[Transpose]"
.index "&%[transpose]%&"
.index "transposition" "for one stave"
The &%[transpose]%& directive specifies that subsequent notes on the current
stave are to be transposed by a number of semitones. A positive number
transposes upwards; a negative number transposes downwards. If transposition is
also specified at an outer level (either in the header, or by using the &%-t%&
command line option), the transposition specified here adds to, rather than
replaces it, as does any subsequent appearance of &%[transpose%&]. Octave
transposition, as specified in a clef-setting directive or by the &%[octave]%&
directive, is also added to any general transposition.

.index "key signatures" "after transposition"
.index "transposition" "control of keys"
PMW does not transpose the current key signature that is already set for the
current stave when it encounters the &%[transpose]%& directive, but it does
transpose any subsequently encountered key signatures, except for the
non-transposing pseudo-key N. To ensure a transposed key signature for a
stave which has its own transposition specified, you should include the key
signature after &%[transpose]%&, even if it is the same key signature that is
specified in a header directive for the whole piece.
.code
key G
[stave 1]
...
[endstave]
[stave 2 transpose 1 key G]
...
[endstave]
.endd
Note that it is the &'old'& key signature that is specified. In this example it
is transposed to become A-flat. Further details about transposition of notes
are given in section &<<SECTtransposition>>&, and details of the transposition
of chord names are given in section &<<SUBSECTtranchordnames>>&.


.subsection "[Transposedacc]"
.index "&%[transposedacc]%&"
.index "accidentals" "forcing transposed"
This directive must be followed by one of the words `force' or `noforce'. It
changes the option for forcing an accidental on a transposed note when there
was an accidental on the original, even if the accidental is not strictly
needed (&R; &<<SECTtransposition>>&).


.subsection "[Treble]"
.index "&%[treble]%&"
This specifies a treble clef (&R; &<<SECTclef>>&).


.subsection "[Trebledescant]"
.index "&%[trebledescant]%&"
This specifies a treble clef with a little `8' above it (&R;
&<<SECTclef>>&).


.subsection "[Trebletenor]"
.index "&%[trebletenor]%&"
This specifies a treble clef with a little `8' below it (&R;
&<<SECTclef>>&).


.subsection "[TrebletenorB]"
.index "&%[trebletenorB]%&"
This specifies a clef that is exactly like the trebletenor clef, except that
the little `8' is enclosed in parentheses.


.subsection "[Tremolo]"
.index "&%[tremolo]%&"
.index "tremolo" "between notes"
.index "notes" "tremolo between"
Tremolo marks that appear as beams between notes that are not normally beamed,
or as disconnected beams between notes, are notated by &%[tremolo]%& between
the two notes (or chords). There are two optional qualifiers: &`/x`& followed
by a number specifies the number of beams to draw, and &`/j`& followed by a
number specifies the number of beams that are to be joined to the note stems.
The default is to draw two beams, neither of which is joined to the stems.
.code
g [tremolo] b
.endd
This example outputs two crotchets with two disconnected beams between them.
.code
G [tremolo/x3/j3] B
.endd
This example outputs two minims, joined by three beams. The &`/j`& qualifier
should not be used with breves or semibreves. For the most commonly encountered
tremolos, it is necessary to use a note of the `wrong' length. For example, a
tremolo that lasts for the length of a crotchet is shown as two crotchets, at
the positions two quavers would occupy, with tremolo bars between them. This
effect can be achieved by using the masquerading feature described in section
&<<SUBSECTnoteexpr>>&. Here are some examples:
.code
d-\m\ [tremolo] g-\m\;
d-\m\ [tremolo/j1/x3] g-\m\;
d\M\ [tremolo] g\M\
.endd

.music "music62" 30 6,-16

The &%[tremolo]%& directive must appear between two notes in a bar. An error
occurs if it appears at the beginning or end of a bar, or if it is preceded or
followed by a rest. It assumes that the notes are of the same kind, and have
their stems in the same direction. Notes with flags should not be used, though
tremolos can be added underneath the normal beams of a beamed group if
necessary. From release 5.32 &%[tremolo]%& has an effect on MIDI output.


.subsection "[Tripletize]"
.index "&%[tripletize]%&"
This directive enables and disables `tripletizing', which causes certain
groups of regularly notated notes to be positioned (and played if MIDI is
generated) as triplets. Details are given in section &<<SUBSECTtripletize>>&.


.subsection "[Triplets]"
.index "&%[triplets]%&"
This directive is a synonym for &%[tuplets]%&.


.subsection "[Tuplets]" SUBSECTtuplets
.index "irregular note groups" "suppressing the number"
.index "irregular note groups" "forcing position"
.index "irregular note groups" "forcing brackets"
.index "&%[tuplets]%&"
This directive is used to control the marks on triplets and other irregular
note groups. It must be followed by one or more of the words `on', `off',
`above', `below', `bracket', `nobracket, or `auto'. `On' and `off' apply to the
number, with or without a bracket, that appears above or below a tuplet group.
The default is `on'. When `off' is specified, nothing is output. Note that the
qualifier &`/x`& can be used to suppress the number for an individual tuplet,
or to enable it, if it has been previously disabled. The other words set
default options for irregular note groups, and they are independent of each
other.
.code
[tuplets above]
.endd
This example causes all the irregular note marks to be placed above the notes,
but (unlike the &`/a`& option on an individual group) it does not specify
whether a horizontal bracket should be drawn. The words `above' and `below' can
be followed by a dimension, to set a fixed vertical position for all subsequent
irregular note group marks. If the dimension is preceded by &`+`& or &`-`&,
this does not set a fixed position, but provides a default vertical adjustment
for subsequent irregular groups.
.code
[tuplets above +4]
.endd
This example causes subsequent marks to be four points higher than they would
otherwise appear. Brackets can be forced or inhibited by means of `bracket' and
`nobracket'. If neither has been specified, a bracket is drawn unless the note
group is beamed.

The `auto' option resets both the position and the bracketing options to their
initial states, where the marks are placed above or below the notes, depending
on their pitch, and the bracket is omitted if the notes are beamed. Options
given on an individual note group override the defaults set by the
&%[tuplets]%& directive. Note that the use of &`/a`& or &`/b`& forces a
bracket to be drawn, unless followed by &`/n`&.


.subsection "[Ulevel] and [ulhere]" SUBSECTulevelhere
.index "&%[ulevel]%&"
.index "&%[ulhere]%&"
.index "underlay" "level"
.index "level" "of underlay"
For each stave, PMW computes a default level for underlay text. The standard
position for this level (the base line level for the text) is 11 points below
the bottom line of the stave, but a lower level may be chosen if there are low
notes on the stave. There are two different ways of changing this level.
&%[Ulhere]%& specifies a temporary change for the current line, and
&%[ulevel]%& sets an absolute level to be used until further notice.
&%[Ulhere]%& takes a positive or negative number of points as an argument. This
is added to the automatically computed level for the line in which the current
bar appears.
.code
[ulhere -2]
.endd
This example has the effect of lowering the current underlay line by two
points. If a subsequent occurrence of &%[ulhere]%& appears in the same line for
the same stave, it is accepted if its argument is negative and specifies a
lower level than the previous one, or if its argument is positive and all
previous ones were positive and it is greater than any of them. &%[Ulhere]%&
has no effect if an absolute underlay level is being forced by means of the
&%[ulevel]%& directive, which sets a level relative to the bottom of the stave.
.code
[ulevel -15]
.endd
This example sets a level fifteen points the bottom of the stave. &%[Ulevel]%&
takes effect for the text under all the notes that follow it, even if the text
was input earlier as part of a multi-syllable input string. &%[Ulevel]%& may
appear as often as necessary; its effect lasts until the end of the movement or
its next appearance. However, if &%[ulevel]%& appears with an asterisk for an
argument, the underlay level reverts to the value automatically selected by
PMW, and any subsequent &%[ulhere]%& directives are honoured.


.subsection "[Ultextsize]"
.index "&%[ultextsize]%&"
.index "underlay" "text size"
This directive must be followed by a number in the range 1 to 20. It selects
the default size to be used for underlay text on the current stave. The actual
font sizes that correspond to the twenty numbers are set by the &%textsizes%&
header directive. If this directive is not used, the size set by the
&%underlaysize%& header directive (which is different from any of the sizes
set by &%textsizes%&) is used. &%[Ultextsize]%& is normally needed only if you
want different sizes of underlay text on different staves.


.subsection "[Unbreakbarline]"
.index "&%[unbreakbarline]%&"
.index "bar lines" "breaking"
An occurrence of this directive causes the bar line at the end of the current
bar to be extended downwards onto the stave below. This could be used, for
example, to output a double barline right through a system at the end of a
verse or other important point in a choral piece, where the barlines are
normally broken after each stave. See also &%[breakbarline]%&.


.subsection "[Underlayfont]"
.index "&%[underlayfont]%&"
.index "fonts" "default for underlay"
.index "underlay" "default font"
The default typeface for underlay text can be set for an individual stave by
means of the &%[underlayfont]%& directive. This directive takes as its argument
one of the standard font names.
.code
[underlayfont extra 3]
.endd
This example supposes that the third extra font has been defined for use in
underlay text. The default typeface for underlay text is roman. In any given
text string it is always possible to change typeface by using the appropriate
escape sequence.


.subsection "[Xline]"
See &%[line]%& (&R; &<<SUBSECTline>>&) and also section &<<SUBSECTxslur>>&.


.subsection "[Xslur]"

.chapter "PostScript vs PDF" CHAPPDFPS
.index "PostScript" "vs PDF"
.index "PDF" "vs PostScript"
The ability to create PDFs directly was introduced at PMW release 5.30. The PDF
format is now standardised and is widely supported by viewing and printing
software. Earlier versions of PMW can generate only PostScript, which is a page
description language, originally created by Adobe for controlling laser
printers. Some printers can interpret PostScript directly; for others
intermediate translation software such as &'GhostScript'& is needed.
Appropriate translation is often automatically installed in printing systems.
&'GhostScript'& can be used to interpret PostScript for display on the screen
and to convert it into a PDF.

A PDF created directly by PMW will be larger than one created by running
PostScript output through &'GhostScript'& because &'GhostScript'& can
deconstruct fonts and include only those characters that are actually used in
the PDF. PMW always includes entire fonts when it creates a PDF, except for the
fourteen `standard' fonts that can be assumed available in all PDF processors.

PMW supports only OpenType (&`.otf`&) fonts when generating PDF output. The PDF
format does support other types of font, but as there are several utilities for
converting PostScript Type 1 and TrueType fonts to OpenType, this is not seen
as a major issue.

.chapter "Changes for release 5.00" CHAP500
There was a major revision of the code for release 5.00. Many previously
existing input files should continue to work as before, but there have been
some changes. A number of deprecated obsolete features, some of which have not
been documented for a long time, have been removed. There are also some
extensions and simplifications.

.ilist
There is no longer the need to use &%barcount%& for movements longer than 500
bars, and some other limits have been removed or relaxed.
.next
Extra fonts are now accessed in strings by, for example, \xx2\ rather than
\x2\, which is ambiguous; it could be a hexadecimal character number. The old
notation is, for the moment, still interpreted as a font change, but gives a
warning.
.next
The synonym &%-includefont%& for &%-includePMWfont%& is removed.
.next
The synonym &%origin%& for &%originx%& in draw functions is removed.
.next
Earlier versions of PMW used a more restricted set of options starting with
&`/s`& to control split slurs. These are no longer supported.
.next
All the deprecated directives whose names began with `old' have been removed.
.next
An obsolete feature of irregular note groups, allowing a hyphen after the count
of regular notes (e.g. &`{3-/11`&) is removed.
.next
Support for including literal PostScript has not been retained. It could be
put back should anyone actually need it.
.next
A list of numbers that follows some directives must now be all on one line.
Such lists can no longer be automatically continued onto the next line by
terminating the first line with a comma. Instead, use the &`&&&&&&`& facility
to concatenate input lines.
.next
If a character that is treated specially in a string is required as a literal,
it must be escaped with a backslash. It no longer works to include it as a
character number, because escape sequences are now processed when a string is
read, before any interpretation.
.next
Similarly, a redundant font change no longer works to disable a kern. You have
to use some actual characters that have no effect on the output, for example
&`\*u*d\`& (which does an up and down move in the music font).
.next
White space is permitted before a beam break character.
.next
The &%accspacing%& directive can now be given with an optional sixth value,
giving the width for the narrower style 0 half sharp.
.next
The &%timefont%& directive must precede &%printtime%& if it is to apply to the
strings in &%printtime%&.
.next
A completely empty stave now starts with a clef unless there was a previous
&%[noclef]%& setting.
.next
A masquerade setting for a chord must appear on the chord's first note.
.next
The test output files in the &_testdist/outfiles_& directory are no longer
complete PostScript files that include the music font. However, they can be
viewed by a command such as:
.code
cat PSheader testdist/outfiles/Test01.ps | gv -
.endd
though this method does not show a list of page numbers.
.next
The separate font name &`bigmusic`& is abolished.
.next
&%[omitempty]%& is no longer a separate directive, but is instead an option of
the &%[stave]%& directive, because it applies to the entire stave.
.next
[&%Stavelines]%& also applies to the whole stave; it still works, but is now
deprecated, with a warning message. Instead of &%[stavelines 3]%& (for
example), you should now use &%[stave n/3]%&.
.next
Slur and line ids are now required to be ASCII alphanumeric characters.
.next
The obsolete directives whose names began with `play' have been removed
(replace `play' with `midi').
.next
The obsolete &%[percussion]%& directive is removed.
.next
The [move] directive can now move rests vertically as well as horizontally.
.next
A Unicode translation (&`.utr`&) file can now specify the character to use for
unsupported code points in non-standardly-encoded fonts.
.endlist

.chapter "Characters in text fonts" CHAPunifont
.index "Unicode" "character list"
.index "fonts" "Unicode characters"
.index "PostScript" "Unicode characters"
.index "accented characters in strings" "list of"
Text fonts such as &'Times-Roman'& that use the Adobe standard encoding contain
over 300 characters. From release 4.10, PMW gives access to all these
characters by making use of Unicode encoding, which allows for character codes
that are greater than 255. There are several ways in which characters other
than the standard ASCII set can be represented in PMW text strings; these are
described in section &<<SUBSECTescaped>>&. This chapter lists all the
characters in the standard text fonts, with their Unicode values (in
hexadecimal, as is conventional), their PMW escape sequences when defined, and
their character names. However, some of these characters may be missing in
older fonts.

The use of the escape sequence &`\fi`& for the `fi' ligature is no longer
necessary, because PMW now automatically uses the ligature for variable width
fonts when it is available. The escape sequence is retained for backwards
compatibility. PMW does not use the `fl' ligature automatically.

Characters whose code values are less than 007F (127) are ASCII characters that
correspond to the keys on the computer keyboard. However, in PMW strings, the
literal characters grave accent and single quote (codes 0060 and 0027) are
converted into Unicode characters 2018 and 2019 so that they appear as opening
and closing quotes, respectively. If you want an actual grave accent or an
ASCII single quote character, you can use the escape sequences &`\``& and
&`\'`&.

.index "music font characters"
.index "fonts" "music font characters"
.index "fonts" "PMW-Music"
.index "PMW-Music font"
This chapter contains a list of all the characters in the PMW-Music font.
Characters from this font can be referenced by number in character strings
(&R; &<<SUBSECTmusicchars>>&). Those with character codes less than 127 can
also be referenced by switching to the music font and entering the
corresponding ASCII character or giving the Unicode code point if there is one.
The following three examples produce the same effect:
.code
"\rm\this clef \*33\ is treble"
"\rm\this clef \mu\!\rm\ is treble"
"\rm\this clef \mu\\x1D11E\\rm\ is treble"
.endd
The second method is more convenient when a whole sequence of music font
characters is required. Character 33 in the music font (which corresponds to an
exclamation mark in ASCII) is the treble clef.

Most of the characters in the music font are positioned `on the baseline' in
the typographic sense, though some have `descenders'. The only exceptions to
this are the constituent parts of notes, such as stems and quaver tails. The
typographic character widths, which may or may not be used by PMW when setting
music, are mostly set to values that are reasonable when these characters are
part of a text string.

Here is a list of the characters in the font, giving both their numbers (in
decimal) and, where relevant, the corresponding ASCII characters and Unicode
code points. The character width is also given as a fraction of the font size.
For example, when a 10-point treble clef is output, its width is 15 points.

The characters numbered 32, 118&--126, and 185&--188 do not cause anything to
be output; instead they just cause the current position to be moved by a
distance that depends on the point size of the font.

&*Note*&: All these characters exist as actual characters in the original
PostScript version of the font, which is in a file called &_PMW-Music.pfa_&.
From release 5.20 an OpenType version called &_PMW-Music.otf_& is also provided
because the PostScript font formats are becoming obsolete.

The OpenType format does not support leftwards, upwards, or downwards movements
in fonts whose primary movement is to the right. For this reason, the PMW
program has been updated so that it no longer relies on the font mechanism for
such movements. Instead, when it encounters any of these characters, it
emulates what would happen with the original PostScript font. This means that
PMW output works with either form of the font, but if the OpenType font is used
with any other program, the characters with unsupported movements are not
available.

The values given in the table above are the factors by which the font's point
size must be multiplied in order to get the relevant distance. For example, if
a 10-point font is in use, character number 119 (w) moves the current position
down by 4 points. If a space character (number 32) is output from the music
font, it moves the position by 0.75 units to the right.

There is a discussion on the use of the special characters for guitar chord
grids in section &<<SUBSECTguitargrids>>&. The larger round and square brackets
(characters 139&--142) are designed so that they can be output directly before
and after an accidental, except that for a flat they need to be raised by one
note pitch (2 points). The large circle characters have a diameter of two stave
spaces, and are intended for original time signatures (see the example in
section &<<SUBSECTtimefont>>&). The slanting arrows are for use at the ends of
staves when a stave containing multiple parts is about to be split into two or
more staves, and &'vice versa'&.

The slur characters are not used by PMW itself, but are for showing ties when
using note characters in text. The first is the correct width for two
successive note characters; the second is the correct width when the first note
is followed by a dot. Because they have zero width, they should be placed
before the notes.
.code
"\**m.\ = \mf\\149\\51\\53\"
.endd
This example is output as:&~&~ &{&#51;&#63;}& = &{&#149;&#51;&#53;}&

.index "PMW-Alpha font"
Richard Hallas contributed an auxiliary font for use with PMW and other
programs. It is called PMW-Alpha, because it is designed for music symbols that
are useful in conjunction with normal alphabetic text. The font was originally
designed as an Acorn RISC OS font; a PostScript Type 3 version was generated
automatically from the original and was distributed with PMW up to and
including version 5.30. Later releases of PMW include a Type 1 version of this
font, created manually from the Type 3 version, together with an automatically
generated OpenType version. This means it can be used with both PostScript and
PDF output. The characters that PMW-Alpha contains fall into four classes:
.ilist
There is a set of letters such as &{-f-}& and &{-p-}& which are in a style
commonly seen in music, and which can be used for dynamic marks.
.next
There is a set of digits in a style commonly seen in time signatures, together
with a matching plus sign.
.next
There is a set of fractions, suitable for use in organ registrations. There are
also two sets of small digits, one raised and one lowered, that can be used to
build additional fractions.
.next
There are small versions of many music characters such as notes, accidentals,
and clefs. These are at appropriate sizes for mixing with text fonts of the
same nominal size, which makes it easier to include them with text when using
desktop publishing programs.
.endlist

.section "Use of PMW-Alpha from within PMW"
Here is an example of some header directives that could be used to make use of
the PMW-Alpha font from within PMW:
.code
Textfont extra 1 "PMW-Alpha"
Timefont extra 1
*Define f    "\xx1\f"
*Define fr37 \xx1\\203\\222\\217\
.endd
The &%textfont%& directive sets up PMW-Alpha as the first extra font; the
&%timefont%& directive specifies that numerical time signatures are to use this
font. The first &%*define%& directive defines a macro for the &'forte'& mark
&{-f-}&. The second macro is for the fraction &{-&#203;&#222;&#217;-}&. It is
set up without surrounding quote marks so that it can be included in a longer
string, for example:
.code
"an unusual fraction is &fr37\rm\"
.endd


.section "Use of PMW-Alpha in other programs"
From within a desktop publishing program, PMW-Alpha can be used as a kind of
musical typewriter. Richard Hallas explains:

``The keys Q, W, E, R, T, Y produce notes of descending duration from breve to
semiquaver. The lower-case versions of the letters produce notes with up-stems,
and the upper-case characters produce down-stem notes. The dot key produces a
dot which is suitable to follow any up-stem note, and the > key (shifted dot)
produces a suitable dot for the down-stem notes. There are also some simple
beams which can be used with the crotchet characters. The keys h, j, and k
produce beams for upstemmed notes, while H, J, and K are for use with
downstemmed notes. They should be typed after the first note, and all have a
width of zero, so do not move the cursor. For example, typing `rh,r RK><R'
produces &{-rh,r RK><R-}&.

The five keys to the left of &%return%& produce rests: [ and ] for a semibreve
rest &{-[-}& and a minim rest &{-]-}&, semicolon and quote for a quaver rest
&{-;-}& and a semiquaver rest &{-&#39;-}&, and / for a crotchet rest &{-/-}&.
Pressing any of these keys in conjunction with &%shift%& produces a smaller
version of each rest, suitable for use in among the notes. The letters G, B and
V produce treble, bass, and alto clefs, and are named after the G clef, Bass
clef and Viola clef. These are suitable for use with the notes.

These symbols may of course be used on their own, but a stave symbol is also
provided so that the symbols can be printed on it. The symbols have all been
positioned correctly so that the work with the stave. The stave is obtained by
entering the `hard' space character ASCII 160. (How you do this depends on the
keystroke conventions of your wordprocessor.) The stave character has a width
of zero, so following it with one of the notes etc. will produce a composite
symbol. The actual space taken up by the stave character is 640, the same as
the normal space character moves, so a string of alternating hard and soft
spaces produces an empty stave.

The breves are not supposed to be used with dots, and have a width of 640. All
the other notes have a width of 380 and can be followed by either two dots, a
dot and a `dot space' (< character) or a `double-dot space' (comma character)
to make up a 640-width `unit'.

The three clefs each have a 640 `unit-width'. The small rests have a width of
260, and can either be followed by a note or a `note space' (\ character). The
| character produces a bar line, whose actual width is identical to its
printing width so that it can be immediately followed by another stave
character.

&*Example*&: If `Hd' represents a hard space character, this sequence
.display
Hd V Hd < Hd Q Hd < | Hd < Hd E > < Hd R , | Hd , Hd e , Hd } \ |
.endd
produces:
.display
&{+&~V&~<&~Q&~<|&~<&~E><&~R,|&~,&~e,&~}\|+}&
.endd

There are two systems available for fractions. Firstly, the most common
fractions &{-&#185;-}&, &{-&#178;-}&, and &{-&#179;-}& are in the ASCII
positions normally occupied by superscript digits &{-&#201;-}&, &{-&#202;-}&,
and &{-&#203;-}&. The standard &{-&#188;-}&, &{-&#189;-}&, and &{-&#190;-}& are
in their normal ASCII positions, and various other common fractions are
available in a fairly sensible order from adjacent characters.

Secondly, any fraction can be made from the individual fraction numbers and
character 222. The ready-made fractions are preferable to the custom ones
because the relative positions of the numbers and the slash are slightly
neater, but nevertheless the custom fractions will usually give a good result.
The fractions are in &'Times-Roman'& style, and should go well with that
font.''

.section "Characters in the font"
Here is a list of the characters in the PMW-Alpha font, in the same format as
the list of characters in the PMW-Music font above. The stemless notes (breve
and semibreve) appear twice, in both the `upstem' and `downstem' positions, and
for technical reasons, the treble clef appears on the lower case g as well as
the upper case G.

.section "Input line concatenation"
A line that ends with &`&&&&&&`& is concatenated with its successor (with
&`&&&&&&`& and the newline removed) before any other processing.


.section "Preprocessing directives"
These may occur at any point in an input file; each one must occupy a line
on its own.
.display
&`*comment `&<&'rest of line'&>
&`*define `&<&'macro name'&>&` `&<&'rest of line'&>
&`*else`&
&`*fi`&
&`*if`& <&'condition'&>
&`*if not `&<&'condition'&>
&`*include `&"&'file name'&"
.endd
A macro name must be followed by parentheses, with optional default argument
values, if it is to be used with arguments.


.section "Macro calls"
.display
&`&&`&&'<macro name><optional semicolon>'&
&`&&`&&'<macro name>'&&`(`&&'<arguments>'&&`)`&
.endd
Macro calls may occur in macro arguments to any depth. Use &`&&)`& or &`&&(`&
to include unmatched parentheses in a macro argument, and &`&&,`& for a comma
at top level (not needed if in matched parentheses or quotes).


.section "Input string repetition"
The argument of a string repetition is processed as a macro argument.
.display
&`&&*`&&'<number>'&&`(`&&'<argument>'&&`)`&
.endd


.section "Header directives"
Those marked with an asterisk may appear only at the head of a PMW input file,
not at the start of the second or subsequent movements. Those marked with a
dagger affect only the movement in which they appear.

.section "Note and rest components"
The order of the items that go to make up one note is given below. Few notes
require all possible components to be present and many are not relevant for
rests. An upper case letter sets the initial note length of a minim, and a
lower case letter is a crotchet, with &`+`&, &`-`&, &`=`&, and &`!`& characters
available to adjust the length. Except for &`!`&, which may only follow an
upper case letter, these can be freely intermixed.

All accents and ornaments except tremolos can be moved in any direction by
following the code with &`/u`&, &`/d`&, &`/l`&, or &`/r`& and a number. For
this reason, the tremolo options must not directly follow an accent or
ornament. Use a space to separate, or put the tremolo first. Tremolos
themselves can be moved up and down, but not left or right. The notation looks
confusing, but is consistent: for example, &`G\//u4\`& specifies a single
tremolo that is moved up by 4 points.

All accents, and the fermata, mordant, trill, and turn ornaments can be shown
in parentheses or square brackets, by following the code with one of:

.section "Hairpin adjustment options"
The &`/a`&, &`/b`&, &`/m`& and &`/w`& options may appear only at the start of a
hairpin. The other options may appear at either end. If vertical movement is
specified at the start of a hairpin, it applied to the whole hairpin. If
specified at the end, it affects only the end.

These options may occur after any text item other than stave names, but for a
rehearsal mark inside square brackets only those specifying movement are
relevant, and &`/bar`&, &`/c`&, &`/cb`&, &`/e`&, &`/nc`&, &`/ne`&, and &`/ts`&
are ignored on underlay and overlay strings. Other restrictions apply to
follow-on strings (&R; &<<SUBSECTfollowon>>&).

Settable font sizes are defined in the header by the &%textsizes%& directive.
For underlay and overlay strings, additional strings may follow as options, to
control the hyphens between syllables (&R; &<<SUBSECTuolayother>>&).

.appendix "Reading MusicXML files" "APPA"
.index "MusicXML" "input files"
The ability to read MusicXML input in addition to PMW's own input format was
added in release 5.10. However, this is highly experimental and is currently
very incomplete (and probably quite buggy). Please do not expect great things
of it.

There is a particular problem with MusicXML parts that use two or more staves.
PMW can mostly handle a treble/bass clef pair if the notes are straightforward,
but MusicXML examples exist which do weird things such as ending a slur on one
stave before starting it on another after `backing up'. This particular case
causes PMW to give an error, but in other situations the result is just crazy
output.

The MusicXML-reading code is an optional part of PMW. To use it you must add
&`--enable-musicxml`& when running &`./configure`& before building PMW. When
this is not done, MusicXML files are still recognized as such, but cannot be
processed and so cause a hard error. There are two situations in which MusicXML
files are recognized:

.ilist
If the first line of PMW's input file begins with &`<?xml version=`& the
file is assumed to be MusicXML, and processed accordingly.
.next
If, within a PMW input file, a file specified by the &%*include%&
preprocessing directive (&R; &<<SUBSECTinclude>>&) begins with &`<?xml
version=`& it is recognized as MusicXML. As long as it is not within a PMW
stave, it is processed, and control then returns to process more PMW input.
If it is within a PMW stave, an error occurs.
.endlist

The second case makes it possible to change some of PMW's behaviour by
including header directives before including a MusicXML file. For example, to
enlarge the music:
.code
magnification 1.1
*include "file.musicxml"
.endd
Not all directives are effective, and some that are may be overridden by the
contents of the MusicXML file. In particular:

.ilist
Key and time signature settings are usually overridden.
.next
Added headings are positioned above MusicXML headings.
.next
Added footings are positioned below MusicXML footings.
.next
No transposition is applied to the MusicXML notes.
.endlist

Some exotic effects are possible by mixing PMW staves with MusicXML files. The
full extent has not been explored.

.appendix "Writing MusicXML files" "APPB"
.index "MusicXML" "output files"
MusicXML is a music encoding that has become popular for exchanging music
information between different applications. It uses the standard XML syntax to
encode the music, and contains performance as well as notational information.
There is a lot of mismatch between the ways in which PMW and MusicXML encode
music. For example, dynamic markings such as &'m&*f*&'& and &'&*pp*&'& are
handled as text strings in PMW whereas MusicXML has dedicated elements for
dynamics.

The ability to write MusicXML output in addition to PostScript, PDF, and MIDI
was added to PMW in release 5.33. However, this is experimental and currently
incomplete (and probably quite buggy). Please do not expect great things of it.

MusicXML output is requested by means of the &%-musicxml%& or &%-xml%& command
line option, which must supply a file name. This output is in addition to the
normal PostScript or PDF output. A MusicXML file can contain only a single
movement, but a PMW input file may contain many. This mismatch has been
addressed in two ways:

.ilist
The &%-musicxmlmovement%& or &%-xm%& command line option can be used to select
a specific movement.
.next
If no movement is selected from a multi-movement PMW file, and the file name
given to the &%-musicxml%& option contains the character sequence &`%d`& with
optional digits between the two characters, then each movement is written as
MusicXML to a separate file, with the movement's number replacing the &`%d`&
sequence, which is used as a format instruction.
.endlist

When using the second strategy, a number included in the &`%d`& sequence
defines the minimum number of digits that are to be inserted. It should
normally be preceded by a zero, which requests leading zeros, as otherwise you
might end up with file names that contain spaces. This example will create
files called &_movement-01.xml_&, &_movement-02.xml_&, etc.

.code
pmw -xml movement-%02d.xml mysymphony.pmw
.endd

If the file name does not contain &`%d`& when no movement is selected, the
first movement is output.

It will never be possible to convert everything that might be in a PMW file
into MusicXML. An obvious example is the use of the drawing facility. After
importing a piece that PMW has exported, it will almost always be necessary to
make some modifications from within the importing program.

Some `difficult' PMW features that are currently missing may be partly or
wholly added later as time permits. MusicXML coding for absolute and relative
positioning of items is often ignored by programs that process it. They tend to
lay out the musical content using their own algorithms. For that reason, many
of PMW's positioning instructions (e.g. the &%[space]%& directive]) are
currently ignored when generating MusicXML output. There are also features that
are straightforward to translate, but which have just been overlooked. I will
add these if asked or if I happen to notice.

Some features that are translatable may or may not be wanted in MusicXML
output. For example, explicit formatting instructions such as &%[newpage]%& may
not be wanted when another typesetting program is used. For this reason, there
are some options for controlling the inclusion of some items. These options are
given as a list of words, separated by plus signs, following the &%-x%& command
line option, without a space. For example:

.code
pmw -xml export.xml -x+newline+newpage something.pmw
.endd

The options are as follows:

.vlist

.vitem "&%newline%&"

The &%[newline]%& directive causes PMW to start a new system in its PostScript
or PDF output. It is ignored when generating MusicXML unless this option is
set.

.vitem "&%newpage%&"

The &%[newpage]%& directive causes PMW to start a new page in its PostScript or
PDF output. It is ignored when generating MusicXML unless this option is set.

.vitem "&%numberlyrics%&"

When there is more than one underlay verse in a vocal part, PMW will output a
number for each &`<lyric>`& item when generating MusicXML. By default, it does
not do this if there is only one verse. There is at least one version of one
processor that completely ignores unnumbered lyrics, so this option is provided
to ensure that even a single verse is numbered `1'. However, this may result in
the addition of the text `1.' at the start.

.vitem "&%suspend%&"

The &%suspend%& and &%[suspend]%& directives can cause staves to be omitted
from systems in PostScript or PDF output when all a stave's bars are empty or
are rest bars. These directives are ignored for MusicXML output unless this
option is set. When it is, the stave bars that were omitted in the PostScript
or PDF output are flagged as non-printing, but because another processor may
put different numbers of bars into its systems, the effect may not be ideal.

.endlist

.section "Specific issues"
Here are a number of specific issues relating to MusicXML output.

.ilist
If a transposition is set, it is the transposed music that is output. The
&`\t`& string escape sequence works.

.next
Settings for stave spacings do not seem to be much honoured. In particular, a
stave spacing of zero probably will not carry over successfully.

.next
Stave 0 is completely ignored.

.next
MusicXML (release 4.0) does not have a way of specifying a footnote that uses
more than one font. Changes of font within a footnote are therefore ignored.

.next
If a PMW string contains just the character 99 or just the character 100 in the
music font, it is translated into a MusicXML &`<segno>`& element.

.next
If the setting &`[bowing below]`& is used, upbow and downbow `accents' are
translated into into MusicXML's &`<toe>`& and &`<heel>`& elements.

.next
Strings that are marked as figured bass are translated into MusicXML's figured 
bass elements, but there may be issues with some of the more complicated ones.
