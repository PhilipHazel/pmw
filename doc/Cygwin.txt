                         ------------------------------

1. Unix environment 

   1.1 Install the Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com) Linux environment
        for windows (by downloading and running the Cygwin setup tool)

        Take note of the location where the Unix user home 
        directory is located (under the "home" folder of the 
        cygwin installation tree).
         

   1.2 When you run the setup tool, suggest your first pass is the 
       default packages selection

   1.3 Run the setup tool again, this time selecting the following
       packages
         - gcc, make (Category "Devel")
         - ghostscript


2. Run cygwin
    
   2.1 Use the desktop shortcut or Start menu
   2.2 This will start a Unix terminal running the bash shell. Use
       standard Unix commands within it
   2.3 The default location when this terminal starts is your Unix home
        directory (see 1.1)

3. Install pmw.

    3.1 Use your Windows web browser to download the pmw tar ball (e.g. pmw.4.12.tar.gz)
    3.2 Using the Unix terminal, create a directory for the pmw installation 
        % cd ~
        % mkdir pmw
    3.3 Use the Windows file browser to move the downloaded tar ball into the
         Unix pmw directory you just created
    3.4 Unpack pmw
        % cd ~/pmw
        % gunzip pmw-4.12.tar.gz
        % tar xvf pmw-4.12.tar
        % cd pmw-4.12
    3.5 Follow the PMW Unix install instructions 
        % ./configure
        % make
        % make install
      By default, pmw will be found in /usr/local 
    3.6 The  binary will be called "pmw.exe"  and it will be in
        your Unix PATH by default
4. Test the installation by trying to build one of the test 
    source files in the pmw distribution tree

   % cd ~/pmw/pmw-4.12/testdist/infiles
   % pmw.exe -incPMWfont Test01

     Note you must provide the -incPMWfont argument to get sensible output,
     which will be called Test01.ps  (a postscript file)

5. Optionally convert postscript file to pdf
    
    6.1 You may prefer to convert to pdf format rather than deal with postscript.
    6.2 You can do this with the eps2pdf application in your Cygwin termninal.  
        You can must install the Cygwin ghostscript package to make this application available.
           % ps2pdf Test01.ps


6. View pdf or postscript file.

    6.1 Use the Windows file browser to navigate to the directory where the postscript or pdf file resides.
    6.2 If the file is postscript, the Ghostview/Ghostscript application can be used to view the postscript file.
         You can download and install these (two separate Windows apps) from  http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost
    6.3 If the file is pdf, you can view this with Adobe Acrobat Reader or some other pdf viewer
