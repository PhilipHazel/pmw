UNIX AND UNIX-LIKE SYSTEMS
--------------------------

I hope that this version of the program will run without problems on all Unix
and Unix-like systems. To install PMW should just be a matter of typing:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

You will probably need root privileges in order to run the install command,
unless your system gives you write access to the relevant directories.

There is a man page that lists the PMW command arguments. However, the main
documentation is provided only as a PDF file in the doc directory. The reason
for this is that characters from the music font appear in the text, and I don't
know of any other way of providing text of this kind.


OTHER SYSTEMS
-------------

PMW consists almost entirely of Standard C code, and so it should be possible
to compile it on any system with a Standard C compiler and library. There is
just one small code section that is Unix-dependent; this is the code that looks
for default options in the user's .pmwrc file. This code can be disabled by
defining -DNO_PMWRC when compiling the init.c module. If you are in an
environment where ./configure can be used, running it as

  ./configure --disable-pmwrc

will have the desired effect. Neil Killeen has kindly provided instructions for
building PMW under Windows, using the Cygwin environment. His notes are in the
file Cygwin.txt in the doc directory of the PMW distribution. Another PMW user
has provided notes for building in Apple Macintosh environments, available in
the file MacOS.txt in the doc directory.
